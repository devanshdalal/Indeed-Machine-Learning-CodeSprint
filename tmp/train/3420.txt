Loan Originators -- Licensed or Non-Licensed -- Work in our Crestwood IL office or from home  My name is Bill O'Boyle and I'm the President of First Equity Home Loans. I have been in the Mortgage Industry for the last 25 years and have enjoyed it every day (almost every day). With mortgage rates going up we all need to change our strategy on how to get business.  I created a new company in 2012 called ProConnect which is helping make First Equity Home Loans bigger than ever before.  First Equity Home Loans is currently hiring and use ProConnect to compliment our mortgage company.  Ever catch yourself saying \"I got a guy for that\"? That's ProConnect, a professional services referral company connecting members to Prequalified service professionals, for free. Professionals like Realtors, Insurance Agents, Home Inspectors, Painters, Heating and Air Conditioning, Attorneys, Auto Mechanics--the list goes on. We have our street team called ProConnectors along with a call center who signs consumers up for FREE to use our service. We project over 75,000 members by year-end using our service. Within 3 years, 750,000 -- 1,000,000 members.  As mentioned, interest rates have gone up and most Loan Originators who focus on Refis will be out of business, finished, fired, laid off... need I say more? It won't matter if you work for a BANK or a BROKER you will be looking for a new career (GUARANTEED). Your employer, the Bank (if you work for a Bank) will eliminate you if you're not producing. I have come up with the solution to not only survive in the short and long term but make more money than ever before.  I'm looking to for 5-7 Loan Originators that have the same drive and passion as I do for the Mortgage Industry.     **We spend approx $1,500-$4,000 per Loan Originator on lead generation **Conv, FHA, Harp, Jumbo, Reverse,Home Path and much more **Excellent Processing staff **Many Lenders to choose from  The Referrals (leads): Referrals are sent to us daily from our street team called ProConnectors and from our large database of members who use our service for free. These are clients who are looking to buy/sell a home in the next 60 days and need our assistance on pre-qualifying them before we give them to our Realtors.  Our Call Center- will be 15 people strong, contacting Consumers, First-Time Home Buyers, Realtors, For Sale by Owner clients, and the list goes on. This process has been working for 25 years.

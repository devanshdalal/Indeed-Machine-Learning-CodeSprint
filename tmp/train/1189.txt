We’re a funded, fast growing start-up working out of an awesome renovated industrial loft-space in the heart of Princeton, NJ (right across the street from the university) with a few other tech companies, a 3D printer, a ping pong table (on which we play an absurdly fun game called ‘volley pong’), and a robot named Einstein.      This production designer position is central to the development of our new features, and to refining our current product.

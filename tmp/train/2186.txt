No hablas ingles? A mi no importa!  I will be doing repair work on a boat in Fort Lauderdale over the next several weeks. I am looking for a helper who is good at miscellaneous fix-it work and/or painting. No boat work experience is required, but would be a plus. Pay is $13 per hour and you would need to be available 9:00-5:00. You must have a reliable vehicle, be able to climb a latter and use standard hand and power tools. Non-smokers only.  Be sure and reply with your cell and the latest time that I can call or text you tonight.  Thanks,  Roy

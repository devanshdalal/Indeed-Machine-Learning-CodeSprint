We're looking for a motivated Superintendent who has 5+ years of commercial construction experience. We are looking for someone who has experience with all phases of ground up projects including site/earthwork, concrete, interior, exterior envelope, etc. We currently have a number of multi-family apartment buildings we're working on and previous experience with this type of construction would be beneficial, but not required.  We're also looking for a strong PM that can multi-task and move between multiple projects at a time. Strong computer and organizational skills are a must. You must have experience with contract negotiations, estimating, budgeting, buying out scope, etc.

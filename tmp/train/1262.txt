We are looking to expand out operations to the Vidalia, GA and Baxley, GA area and we are in the need of experienced technicians to repair flat screen TV's and computer repair.    This is a per call basis - part time.  The pay varies from call to call.      If you have computer repair experience then the TV repair part is simple.  You must be able to solder.  Some of the TV calls all you do is replacing capacitors.      The computer calls are mostly warranty calls where a part is being replaced or a computer is literally being connected to the local internet provider.      Must have your own tools.

Our value proposition is strong, and we have a high close rate and retention rate in our existing markets.  TARGET MARKET:  Young or small companies where the executive team would rather focus their attention on developing their business, and not focus on time consuming processes like finance and accounting.

Great people skills, professional, mature, excellent phone presence, and an ability to articulate our value proposition quickly.  Many of our sales have been closed with only a couple of 30 minute calls.  Detail knowledge of accounting and finance is not a requirement  you dont have to be the expert, you can bring in an expert CFO when you reach that point in the sales cycle if needed.  COMPENSATION:  The compensation will be 100% commission based on successful sales.  Commissions will be a generous percentage of the first year of revenue from each client that signs up for our services.

We are a fast growing company located in Buffalo Grove.   Order Processor: This person will fill orders, sort remotes, be responsible for inventory and complete other tasks assigned by immediate supervisor or other department managers.   There are about 200 orders on a daily basis. Some go USPS First Class, some are USPS Priority 2 day, some are FedEx Overnight and others are FedEx 2 Day. These labels look very similar therefore it is imperative for the right candidate to have a close attention to detail.   The products which we are shipping are auto remotes and keys. Many of these remotes and keys look identical to the naked eye. The only difference may be the FCC ID numbers which are very small and located in numerous places.The difference between a \"6\" an \"8\" could mean the difference between $30,000 and $3,000.   The remotes may need to be cleaned from time to time. It will be necessary for this person to clean remotes, put them together (nothing too advanced), test batteries and otherwise make sure items are in working condition prior to shipment.  Prior experience with remotes, keys or cars is not necessary.  Ideal candidates will be:  - PUNCTUAL - Loyal - ACCURATE - Able to concentrate on tasks - Independent - Team player - ACCURATE - AMAZING with their attention to detail - Enthusiastic - Intelligent - Literate - Comfortable with animals - ACCURATE - Work quickly and efficiently on a daily basis - Able to follow directions explicitly - Have a valid driver's license and insured vehicle.

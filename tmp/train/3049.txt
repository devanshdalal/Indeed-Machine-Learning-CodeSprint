The Association for Financial Professionals (AFP) serves as the preeminent professional network for more than 16,000 treasury and finance professionals. Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, AFP provides members with breaking news, economic research and data on the evolving world of treasury and finance, as well as world-class treasury certification programs, networking events, financial analytical tools, training, and public policy representation to legislators and regulators. AFP is the daily resource for treasury and finance professionals.  AFP members are drawn from a wide range of industries, comprising corporate practitioners (two thirds) and banks and other financial services providers (one third). The typical corporate practitioner member has 16 years of experience in the profession and works for a company with more than $1 billion in annual revenues. These members hold positions as CFO, vice president of finance, treasurer, assistant treasurer, director, financial analyst, or cash manager.  In response to numerous member requests over the years, AFP is launching a new for-profit professional services business unit – AFP Advisor’s Network (AFPAN) - that will provide a technology-enabled capability and benefit to individual members who desire to offer their expertise to member companies in an interim or project-based capacity.

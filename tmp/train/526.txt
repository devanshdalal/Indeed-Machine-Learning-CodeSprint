     Do you love gadgets and love to help people?  Come join our team!  We are looking for team members who can troubleshoot technical problems as well as empathize with frustrated customers.  If that describes you, read more and apply.         Plugable's mission is to deliver great technology products with amazing customer support to back them up.  If you've ever contacted customer support for a product, only to find they can't help, you know how bad the status quo is.  That's *not* us.  We love our customers, we love our products, and we're not afraid to break new ground to deliver better customer support.         We provide support primarily online and via email so solid writing skills are essential. Each case is an opportunity to document the problem and solution, so future customers can find answers more quickly. We don't provide a support phone number, but we do call customers back from time to time.         It is best if you are comfortable working in a mix of Windows, Mac, and Linux environments. And you need to be familiar with the common problems that can go wrong with USB, PCI, Bluetooth, and network devices - and how to configure the devices and debug problems in the different operating systems.  We are looking for junior or senior level people.  If you have no troubleshooting, customer service, testing, and/or debugging experience please donâ€™t apply.    We offer:   * A flexible, small company atmosphere based in Bellevue, Wa  * We serve our customers, not management or metrics   * A health reimbursement account, funded monthly by the company   * 15 paid vacation days per year (5 company holidays, 10 additional personal days)   * 5 paid sick days per year         Please ensure your cover letter is in the body of the email and shows off your best writing.  And please attach your resume as a pdf only.

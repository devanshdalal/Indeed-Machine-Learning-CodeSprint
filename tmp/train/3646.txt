Living Hope Community Church, in Spokane Valley, WA, is looking for a part-time office manager for our church. We are group of Christ-followers who are passionate about showing people in the Valley who Jesus is.   We are currently a smaller congregation who currently have fairly minimal needs in our office, but we do need someone to work one day a week for 4-5 hours to help with general office work (mailing, filing, updating records, communication, weekly bulletins, etc.) and eventually bookkeeping. There is potential for this job to grow into more hours as our church grows.  As we are a Christian church, it is important to us that you also consider yourself to be a follower of Christ. We are not concerned that you attend our church, just that you find yourself connected to some community of believers.   Applicants with backgrounds in bookkeeping are preferred, but a bookkeeping background is not necessary. If you enjoy office work and are task oriented, we are interested in talking to you.   Please submit a resume and short letter of why this position would interest you.

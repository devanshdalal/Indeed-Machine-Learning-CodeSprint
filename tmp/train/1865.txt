We need sales professionals who are familiar with translation industries or other related industries that need translation. Your own database of contacts is preferred to succeed in this job.  We are a company that offers excellent quality, competitively priced translation, editing, writing, and proofreading services in more than 50 languages around the world.   Your role is to find the clients who are able to place relatively medium or high volume orders. You will be able to choose the strategy of generating sales, subject to our approval. We will assist you in establishing credibility by providing client-specific samples free of charge. The job is entirely commission-based and we intend to pay 10% of the revenues generated by the SP. The commission will be paid by either PayPal or Bank transfer within 3 days of receipt of the payment from the client. We will continue to pay you the commission for 12 moths following the client introduction (if your role ends at that time) or for as long as you are actively engaged in maintaining the relationship with the client.  We expect that the qualified salespersons will be able to generate $3000+ commission per month.  Further details will be sent to the qualified candidates. We prefer the person to be based in top 20 markets of the world.

We pride ourselves in our high quality pizza and even higher quality service. This is a fast paced, busy place with a high volume of regular customers. Candidates must have exceptional people skills and pride in their work. Pizza experience is a plus, but not required.       Although staff are scheduled for specific jobs (cashier, driver, cook) everyone is expected master a variety of skills so that they can step up and meet changing needs. Average employee hours range from 20 to 35 hours per week. Hours are from 9:00 am to 10:30 pm.

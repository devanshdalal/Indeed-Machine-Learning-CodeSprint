About our organization: Common Cause is a nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy organization founded in 1970 by John Gardner as a vehicle for citizens to make their voices heard in the political process and to hold their elected leaders accountable to the public interest. Common Cause aims to strengthen public participation in government; curb the excessive influence of money in politics; ensure that government serve the common good, rather than special interests; promote fair, honest and transparent elections; and fight for a vigorous, independent and diverse media. The Hawaii chapter is based in Honolulu, with active members and supporters throughout the state. For more information, please visit www.example.com.    Common Cause Hawaii is looking for interns in Honolulu, Hawaii. Interns will learn about and work on Common Causeâ€™s key issues of money in politics, voting and elections, ethics in government, and accountability and transparency. Projects may involve research and writing, public outreach, event planning, media and communications, and monitoring government meetings. Interns will gain an understanding of the workings of Hawaii politics, learn about citizen engagement, and gain expertise in current democracy issues and the state and national level.    Currently we are accepting internship applications for Summer 2012. Undergraduate students, graduate students, and recent graduates are welcome to apply. Although there are no strict qualifications for interns, they must have enthusiasm for democracy issues and a commitment to public service.

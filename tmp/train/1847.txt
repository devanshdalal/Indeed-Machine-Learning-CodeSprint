Our growing foreclosure defense and consumer law firm is looking for an associate attorney to assist homeowners and consumers through litigation.  90% of our practice is complex foreclosure defense and 10% is general consumer related (CSPA, FDCPA, etc.)  Excellent academic credentials are required, and recent law school graduates are welcome to apply.    Candidates should be comfortable learning multiple new areas of complex law at a quick pace and have a desire to litigate cases.  You should be professional and demonstrate compassion towards others, but be tenacious in the face of adversity and have “thick skin.”  This practice area requires a long-term outlook and the ability to assimilate complex law into easily understandable argument.  Great candidates will have a strong attention to detail, outstanding time management skills, and a can-do attitude.  You must be willing to take on responsibility immediately and will be responsible for all aspects of cases under the supervision of a senior attorney.      This position entails mostly motion practice, with some depositions, trial work, and appellate work.  Thus, a moderate knowledge of state and federal rules of procedure is necessary, and an understanding of financial documents and real estate is helpful but not required.   If you want to litigate cases, develop the law, and be kept busy, this may be the position for you. The position pays between $43,000 and $55,000 per year for work/life balance, but we offer additional hours for those that seek it. Healthcare, bonuses, and paid vacation time are also available.  Our office is located in Easton Towne Center and parking is free. Please visit our website at www.example.com to learn about our firm. Please submit a resume, cover letter, transcript, and writing sample via email to Mr. Doucet at your earliest convenience.

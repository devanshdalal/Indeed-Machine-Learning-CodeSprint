We are currently looking for a Property Manager to be based out of our corporate office to coordinate the maintenance needs of all properties.  This position is an administrative position responsible for organizing and coordinating these efforts; it is not a position that will physically require you to go on-site and fix items.  A successful candidate will have a strong attention to detail, be very organized and have a basic knowledge of real estate and property maintenance concepts.  This position can be full or part-time and will work during our main business hours in addition to being on call to help \"quarterback\" any emergencies that happen after hours.  This position will also be responsible for assisting with residential leasing as needed.  If you are interested in learning more, please apply today through this website.

*ABOUT US*  FableLabs builds awesome story-driven games for the tablet and web.  We take the best storytelling elements of RPGs / adventure games but make the gameplay accessible, free-to-play and fun for those who don’t have 6 hour blocks of time to play (e.g. folks with jobs).  There are an overwhelming number of talented artists and writers buried on massive AAA projects. We've built technology that can empower tiny teams of storytellers to create stories worth telling for a huge audience.  Our team has built and scaled products with million of users, we’ve signed long term deals with publishers that want to distribute our games on the web and mobile platforms, and we've recently closed on fundraising to triple our team. We're looking for folks that thrive when given significant responsibility, an atmosphere that stresses continuous learning, and a touch of chaos as we explore uncharted territory.   *ABOUT YOU*  If you like rapidly prototyping game designs to find the fun in games and then figuring out how to make them scale once you've located interesting game mechanics, you'll fit right in.  If you have a strong eye for product and crave responsibility instead of being simply an executioner, we want to hear from you. Everyone seems to be looking for a rockstar/pirate/ninja hacker in the Bay Area but we'll settle for passionate developers who love dissecting games.  *YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES*  * Creating systems that allow for quick prototype of game designs * Building fun game designs into reusable, scalable building blocks that can be used in our platform * Building awesome games you're actually proud of.

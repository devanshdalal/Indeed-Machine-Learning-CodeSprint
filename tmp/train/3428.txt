FOUND MY ANIMAL's goal is to help raise awareness of the urgent need for animal adoption. Inspired by a family member working as a fisherman, our founder made her rescue pup the very first 3-strand, hand-spliced and whipped rope leash back in 2006. Nothing like it existed in the market, so by 2007, Found My Animal got started making the same unique nautical leads for our customers. We manufacture, market, and ship all of our products from our office in the Pfizer Building in Brooklyn, NY. We now sell our products directly on-line and through retailers around the world.   Found My Animal is a certified B Corporation. We are committed to a business model that drives positive social and environmental change.  A small but fast growing business, we are looking for a new team member:  Skilled worker who likes working with their hands Detail oriented Manufacturing background Experience with a sewing machine (a plus)  We will train the right candidate.  The right candidate can expect competitive pay, and opportunity to grow with an exciting business.

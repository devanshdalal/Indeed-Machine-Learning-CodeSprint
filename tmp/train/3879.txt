Specifically, someone with an abundance of knowledge associated with CPT codes and reimbursement through Blue Cross Blue Shield.  The Thera-Lase system is a new high powered non-invasive laser therapy system  which induces certain photochemical reactions in  the soft tissues of both humans and animals, and provides healing.   Non-invasive laser treatment, also known as laser photo-biostimulation,  cold laser, or soft laser is defined as a concentrated laser light energy delivered to the cellular level within the body to stimulate live tissue to heal  and is used to treat chronic and acute soft tissue injuries.  The Thera-Lase system precipitates a complex set of physiological interactions at the cellular level  that reduces acute inflammation, reduces pain, and accelerates tissue  healing.    The treatment is delivered as a function of, and is dependent on wavelength, power, and time. Wavelength and power factors determine the penetration depth and  quantity of energy available to transfer to the cells, and the type of healing  determines the length of time needed to administer the treatment.

Driving sales and making plan is the main objective of the Regional Sales Manager. Achieving plan is obtained by constant communication with your sales team/managers via phone, email and face-to-face interaction. An interest in interior design and the latest home trends is helpful when merchandising each gallery to the tastes of our Macy’s guests. It is the Regional Sales Manager’s responsibility to hold store management accountable to Fine Rug Gallery standards regarding gallery appearance and signage. Hosting individual or group training sessions throughout the year is an important element for not only new hires, but maintaining the interest of veteran employees as well. Leading by example by spending time on the sales floor, training alongside, and coaching sales associates are all essential factors in this leadership role. A strong desire to sell and provide outstanding service to all Macy’s guests is an absolute must! Must have driver’s license and means of transportation. Must have some degree of flexibility with travel schedule on an as-needed basis. Specifically over-nights in out-lying stores (Reno and Fresno) when necessary.  Also must be expected to work normal retail hours: nights, weekends, most holidays. Job requires some degree of physical labor including flipping rug piles, climbing ladders, merchandising, building rug pallets, unloading trucks, etc. These duties are not the main focus of Sales Manager, but a willingness to help Operations Team is a positive attribute.  Excellent communication skills, an up beat and positive attitude, and the ability to multi-task are vital characteristics for this position.

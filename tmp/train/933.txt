The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is hiring 30 developers and designers for a two-year fellowship. We’re a brand new agency dedicated to making consumer financial markets work for Americans.    Our team is agile, data-driven, and innovative. The CFPB isn't restricted by bureaucratic legacies. We use GitHub and AWS to ensure a collaborative and flexible team. We have the most serious open source policy in the federal government.     We're building a culture where developers aren't code monkeys but critical leaders in accomplishing the CFPB's mission. Our front-end developers will work closely with subject matter experts to deliver amazing experiences on the web.    Depending upon your skills, you will:    • Design a goal-based consumer experience platform that will empower consumers to take more control over their financial lives    • Script interactions that distill complex data into graphics that impact decision-making    • Refactor consumer response systems to ensure users receive resolutions that are concise and intelligible     • Lay the technological infrastructure of a government agency that puts human centered design first    This is just a short preview of the projects we'll be working on to build a Bureau that delights and empowers consumers for years to come.    Join us.    Questions? We'd love to talk    Please note, only applications from US citizens can be considered.

While considering the performance, demands, and expectations of current online schools, professionals, faculty, and students over the past few years, the project team has concluded that the online education industry is in immediate need for a new business model. Born from these conclusions, the Carefree College project team developed the groundbreaking idea of an employee and student owned post-secondary institution. As the project team continues to build the institutions framework and structure, the final design will allow Carefree College employees and students to secure an ownership interest in the college. The benefits of this new business model for the student, employee, institution, community, and the government are the following:  Student/Employee/Institutional Benefits: Attract and retain quality students, faculty, and employees as owners Provide educational, career, and financial security through ownership Ensure revenues stay within the institution and pass those financial benefits on to Carefree College employees and students  Keep tuition rates affordable with less reliance on student loan funding  Government Benefits:  Ease the burden on the national deficit by reducing dependence on student loans  Create institutional accountability to increase graduation rate  Community Benefits: Job creation resulting in economic growth for local businesses  Increased tax base and quality of life through community and charitable partnerships  At this time, the project team is reaching out to potential faculty, employees, and students whose interests meet the project teams’ needs and goals to discuss an opportunity to participate in the project. This project will provide an opportunity for individuals to take ownership in building the institution which could provide them with both a promising career and future financial returns. While the participation at this stage will be voluntary, the work and contributions provided will be considered as in kind services. When the college completes the curriculum and acquires its accreditation, those in kind services contributed by project members will be evaluated and assigned a value. This value will be transferred to those project contributors in the form of ownership units.

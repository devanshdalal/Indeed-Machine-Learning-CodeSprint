*About* *Hitch* Hitch is a new ride-sharing service that is changing the way people move, and we're looking for your help to do it! Ride-sharing apps pairing passengers with drivers have recently become a popular solution in transportation, but do you ever wonder why two people have to book two separate cars to go between SoMa and North Beach? So did we, which is why we built Hitch! We pair multiple passengers to a single driver.

It's the proven and guaranteed path to launching or expanding a consulting practice. ICP3 participants are licensed as Certified Advisors to represent OED under its flagship Local Business Assistance Program, a unique platform to develop business consulting and business coaching engagements for the advisor’s personal practice.   ICP3 is an ongoing program that prepares, develops, certifies, and supports the participant for as long as he/she desires. The cornerstone of the program is the understanding that running a consultancy and being an independent consultant is a process and profession that continues to grow and change … that one person could never keep up nor compete effectively and efficiently on his/her own. The ICP3, and all its components, are specifically designed to ensure and support the participant’s success.   Training, Guidance, and Mentoring for YOUR Success As a part of ICP3 Certification, each new Certified Advisor is invited to participate in OED’s MasterMind Coaching Program. The program includes facilitated group sessions with other ICP3 Certified Advisors, as well as private time with a senior coach/advisor. Newly Certified Advisors have found these group and individual sessions to be extremely valuable in helping them to ramp up their practices quickly.  End the Feast or Famine Cycle of Self-Employment There are a lot of opportunities, and a lot of ways to launch a consulting business. Many fall victim to the “feast or famine” cycle in their practices. They may feverishly market to generate clients, then become too busy servicing clients to continue to market. Engagements wane and so can income. OED breaks that cycle for our Certified Advisors with long-term, turnkey marketing support. Everyone from the most sales- oriented professional to the most hesitant are fostered through the ICP3, which helps you build your practice without cold calling or hard selling. Rest easy and prepare to meet your new prospects, because as a Certified Advisor, you’ll “have people” to help generate leads.

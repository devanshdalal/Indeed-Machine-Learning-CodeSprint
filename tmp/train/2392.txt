Field Nation, the 43rd fastest growing company in the US, is a Internet based platform that connects companies with people that can perform certain jobs for them.  We have a significantly sized client that performs thousands of quality checks in retail spaces.   They are looking for local  \"Secret Shoppers\" that can act on their behalf for a variety of checks and follow-up visits.  Full Time and Part Time opportunities are available.   *IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENTS AVAILABLE*   You will be required to set up a profile on Field Nation in order to receive assignments, and get paid.  There is no cost for setting up your profile.  We only get paid after you get paid for specific jobs.   If you are selected for work, you will revive an alert (by email or text message).   You can review the details for that specific task.   You only need to reply to the tasks that interest you.    People that perform well may qualify as a \"Preferred Provider\" and may be selected for full -time work.  It all starts with a good profile, so please log-on to get started. the link is:

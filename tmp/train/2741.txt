Health & Life Insurance Agent Position -General Information  As a courtesy we will contact every applicant within 3 days whether we are interested in hiring you on or not, so long as you provide your best contact time in the notes section of your application and you have clearly shown in the resume that you are indeed a licensed life and health agent.    We are looking for full time dedicated, hard working, self-motivated insurance agents.  It is possible to start part time (20 hours per week approximately and then move to full time)  Our agency sells many different products from over 15 of the top carriers.  We specialize in low cost medical plans that provide a great value to the consumer and also sell ancillary products such as critical illness and accident coverage to get a wider scope of benefits at a low monthly rate.  In this regard we stand out from the competition and our clients love us.  Once the \"Obama-care\" metallic plans come into effect we believe our products will be seen as a very viable alternative and should provide a similar level of coverage at about half the price.  We are an A+ agency as rated by the BBB.  Our agency is looking for quality and dependable independent health & life insurance agents to take in.  We will teach you our products and provide you with leads (we always welcome you to prospect on your own as well).    Our products are extremely competitive in both price as well as benefits.  Most of your customers will not be able to out shop our plans and will gladly accept them as a transitioning tool into the new health care reform products, or as an alternative to those products in the coming years.  You will be working from your home or office which will require high speed internet, quality phone service, and an active health & life insurance license.  You will sell most of your insurance over the phone and internet, but you are welcome to sell however you prefer.  Typical earnings for a full time agent are $44,000-$125,000.  Your earning potential is directly correlated to your work ethic.  If you work hard and take direction well you should expect to earn $50,000-90,000 working 40 hours per week.  All customers you contact stay in your book of business.  We are not a captive agency, so you are allowed to sell products outside of our line of carriers (it is acceptable to sell business elsewhere so long as you still generate sales with us).  This is a contract position and is 100% Commission Based.  Commissions paid are at the top of the industry.  You will earn more with us than you would if you got appointed directly with the major insurance carriers, and certainly more than you would if you chose to work as a direct employee of an insurance brokerage.  On a typical insurance sale you should expect to net a profit of $450 if kept only 6 months and $900 if kept for a year.  This means that in order to do well you only need to sell a few plans per week.  Considering that we provide our agents many leads each day, this should be no problem.  These leads are people who have asked for insurance quotes and been notified that an agent would be contacting them to assist them with their insurance.    These leads are interested people, but they have usually been contacted by an agent or two already (from other companies) and are in many cases frustrated with insurance shopping in general by the time you reach them.  it is your job to get through to them, calm them down, tell them what we have to offer, and see if it fits their goals.  If it does, you will then send them links to apply directly online and you will guide them through the application process over the phone.  If you have an interest we would love to hear about any experience you have in the industry, what you feel you can bring to the table as an agent, as well as tell you more about the position available.  Please forward us your resume so that we can get in touch directly.  Our insurance agency is one of the largest insurance marketing organizations in the country.  We are dedicated to the success of our agents and give them the tools, training, and support that they need to become successful independent insurance agents.

We are looking for 1 or 2 people who are comfortable speaking with local small business owners and are interested in learning about mobile marketing and entrepreneurship to sell mobile websites and other marketing services.    More and more people are going mobile and searching for small businesses on their phones, many making buying decisions within an hour from searching. Yet most small businesses don't have mobile specific or mobile optimized websites. You will be educating small business owners on just how much business they are missing out on and offering to build them a demo mobile website for free.    Please send resume and/or linkedin profile link and whether you have any kind of sales or customer experience service. Knowledge of mobile websites or development not necessary but a plus. Bilingual (Spanish) is a big plus. Must have a smartphone and reliable transportation.

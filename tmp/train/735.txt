Livengrin Foundation is a comprehensive behavioral health program specializing in the treatment of alcohol and drug addiction. Livengrin’s mission is to empower the individual to embrace recovery and break the cycle of addiction by providing comprehensive, integrated and holistic treatment services.

Livengrin’s programs have grown with the emerging needs of the marketplace. The original location in Bensalem, just north of Philadelphia, served the rapidly-expanding “commuter communities” of the metropolitan area.

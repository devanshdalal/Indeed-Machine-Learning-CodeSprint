If you are a rockstar frontend designer/developer looking to put your skills to work for the greater good of our society, we have the role for you!  We are a stealth, for-profit startup that is looking to revolutionize the global philanthropic sector by facilitating increased collaboration across professionals working in this space and streamlining the process for which philanthropic initiatives obtain funding and resources.  We are solving a significant, real-world problem and we need your help to ensure that we have beautiful interfaces to make it all work!  The founding team includes startup veterans with a track record of successful exits and are ex-Intel on the technical side and ex-Peace Corps on the philanthropic side.  We are looking for a co-founder who can fill in the gap of design and frontend development.   Ideally, you will have the skills to both design the UI/UX as well as hack some of the code.  We are offering a significant equity stake in the company and co-founder status for the right candidate.  There will be no salary and will be all virtual to start, but we are in the process of putting together our seed round, so that shouldn't last too long.    Did I mention that we are a really fun loving, cool group of do-gooders that are genuinely interested in making the world a better place while also building a great business?   Also - we have a working prototype up and running and more than 20,000 people have signed up to use it!   If this all sounds good to you, drop us a line and we can fill you in on the details.

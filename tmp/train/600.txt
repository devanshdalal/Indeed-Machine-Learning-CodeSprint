Gay, lesbian and transgender psychotherapists sought for a new and innovative telephone and skype therapy business. Clinicians must have 5 years post grad experience, be licensed in the state in which they live and either have a private practice or be prepared to provide services independently. Our agency will provide clients and you will be paid $25 for half hour sessions and $50 for full hour sessions. You will set your own schedule and work from your own place. We anticipate some of the work will be short term and some longer term. Clinicians with good experience working with the trans populations encouraged to apply. Please send resume and letter of interest with relevant work experience especially in regard to working with the LGBTQ population. If a letter is not included, your application will not be considered.    If you know any clinicians who may be interested, please forward.

Prizm Development, the nation’s most experienced developer of Spine Centers of Excellence, has a mature spine center group practice with an internal ASC injection suite, spine surgeons and spine PMR. They are looking for an injectionist and non-injectionist to manage non-surgical treatment options for spine patients.  Prizm’s successful PMR / surgeon / spine therapist team-approach model has been widely copied over the past 20 years. Due to rapid growth of Prizm-developed spine centers, the wait for a new patient appointment slot at some of these centers can exceed a month. Consequently, these spine centers rely on Prizm to locate, screen and interview the best physician candidates for these centers to ensure the right kind of long term match. Prizm is searching for Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation physicians (physiatrists) to fill needed positions at its spine and orthopedic centers across the nation, including Nevada, Washington, Ohio, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia and Alaska.

Penn State Public Media is a leader in developing, funding, and implementing national, multi-faceted projects that link media with public engagement. If you've had others tell you that you can do anything you put your mind to, or others are amazed by your ability to pull off the seemingly impossible, this may be the perfect job for you.   We are a hard-working dedicated team looking for someone who wants to make a difference by applying your project development/management talent. We are looking for an intellectually curious project developer/manager who thrives in a fast-paced environment and enjoys managing multiple projects in various stages of development.   Must have experience developing relationships and working with multiple partners to achieve collaborative goals on time, on budget, and with good humor. This job will be filled as a level 2, or level 3, depending upon the successful candidate's competencies, education, and experience.   Typically requires a Bachelor’s degree or higher plus two years of related experience, or an equivalent combination of education and experience for a level 2. Additional experience and/or education and competencies are required for higher level jobs. Excellent writing and interpersonal communication skills, the desire to work with diverse audiences, and the ability to think and act both strategically and tactically are required. The ideal candidate is enthusiastic about online environments, social media, and the impact that multi-platform media can have. This is a fixed-term appointment funded for one year from date of hire with excellent possibility of re-funding.

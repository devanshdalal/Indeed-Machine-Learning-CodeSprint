Let me introduce you to a job of a lifetime. I am looking for someone that loves the internet and knows wordpress very well. I have multiple sites with each site getting two million hits per week. We are growing in many ways every day, this role may be the most important role I am going to be offering in my company.    I need someone that is very organized and can handle scheduling writers, hosts and other events that are involved with daily operations of the company.    This postiion will be working directly for me and will be able to work virtually, though will be required to come into the office a few times during the week to check in and give updates.     Also, this job will require you to create relationships with Publicists, Talent Managers, Agents, and even talent themselves. With that I need a very strong people person along with a few other requirements.     I do require you use Mac and are able to work with all office applications and quickbooks. Also, I require you have transportation and most importantly, live in LA.     Let me know any interest and we can discuss more details!    Derek Feniger

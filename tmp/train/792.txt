PT owned home care agency is seeking a physical therapist for full or part-time. Most of your patients will be all in one town (Hamden) with a few in Meriden, North Haven, or New Haven at times. Paperwork is very quick and easy and is paper rather than laptop. The drop off for paperwork is right in Hamden. Health, dental, and paid time off are offered. If you wish, you can get paid per visit and be guaranteed as many visits as you choose. Visits are 30 minutes minimum and driving is minimal since you will be mostly in one town and up to 4 towns max for all of your treatments.

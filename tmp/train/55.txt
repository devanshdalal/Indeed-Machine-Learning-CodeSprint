Teachers 2 Go is currently looking for qualified clarinet teachers to teach weekly lessons to clients in the greater Houston area. A Houston-based business since 2005, we are the only Houston-based music education company owned by teachers to bring lessons of all instruments to students in the comfort of their own homes.    Pay is $40/hour, or $25 for each half hour lesson taught. Teachers are paid weekly.  Teachers must have previous teaching experience and a curriculum.     Our company brings teachers to the homes of the students, therefore you must have reliable transportation and a mobile phone.    As a private contractor, you can continue to teach outside the company as much as you like, but we will require your signature on a no-compete agreement that states that you will not teach anyone we introduce you to without going through us.    Working with Teachers 2 Go can be as part time as you wish. You can work only hours and days that are convenient, and you are not required to accept any student. It is always totally up to you.    Please send your name, instrument, academic and teaching qualifications, experience and contact information to our email address, or call us at  XXX   Serious applicants only please.  www.example.com

We are an exterior home remodeling company featuring exterior home improvement products such as Energy-Efficient siding, roofing, windows and patio covers.

Compensation is 50% split after the cost of labor and materials are removed from the total sale of the job. We will supply literature, forms, samples, etc. needed for presentation.   Example of commission structure: If you were to sale a $10,000 job and the cost of material and labor is $6,000, the balance left to split is $4,000, you would get 50% of this $2,000.  That simple, cut and dry.  Submit resume' including a summary of your sales experience and please visit our website at www.example.com or fax resume' to  XXX

Growing Personal Injury Firm looking to add 1 or 2 part time interns to our team.  Our mission is to provide peace of mind to our clients by providing thorough, empathetic, professional customer service dedicated to addressing and resolving all of their post-injury headaches so they can focus on, and get paid for, their efforts to get back to their pre-injury life without having to worry about being taken advantage of by the insurance companies.  We represent people injured in motor vehicle collisions, premises liability accidents, product liability claims, negligent security matters, dog bites, workers' compensation and social security disability matters.  Your goal as a legal intern is to work with the assigned attorneys and case managers to meet deadlines, perform legal research, and review and summarize medical evidence, draft settlement demand letters, create settlement packages, work with with insurance adjusters and medical providers, draft complaints to file in Court, assist with drafting and compiling discovery responses, accompany attorneys to court and depositions, and generally do anything else needed to facilitate a working team environment. It's a small office, so teamwork and professionalism among the office staff is crucial.

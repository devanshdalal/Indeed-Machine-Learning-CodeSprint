Welcome Our company is looking to put together an atmosphere where you can bring together a group of coach's/consultants to help our clients excel in certain phases of their lives in order to move forward to be a more productive and responsible individual in society.  The person we are looking to hire in each area will have the ability to work together with us in a format to achieve the best possible results in an open environment between the coaches and management. We are entrepreneurs at heart with the ability to work with people to inspire us to service our clients in a positive atmosphere which will benefit everyone.   I believe that the environment in a business should be one to enjoy where we can make it fun helping people, yourself included. Our company has a place where we have affordable classes where individuals have specialized attention and  learn and study from our coaches or professional's in their fields.  We strive to service our clients in the best instruction under the most positive atmosphere. My personal philosophy is to make sure all parties enjoy the experience including the instructors/coaches.  Together we can organize and grow to make something very special!!!.\\ My past experience has given me the ability to understand what it takes to commit to this adventure, when I did this in the past it was 6 retail stores for men's apparel.  We created a distribution center and organized it with $500.00 and within a short period turned it into $5,000,000 in sales. You will be a person who has a class of up to 20 individuals working in your expertise in this particular area, I understand you would like to help in all area's of life, still I am looking for specific person who loves what they do in that part of there lives.  recently we have people who would like to teach individuals about diabetes to prevent as well as maintain health choices in regards to solutions in that field, she is passionate about it, with that passion she will excel in her field.  I appreciate also people who tell me about themselves in a cover page on why they would like to help in that particular field.

Once the schedule is set, this person will be responsible for executing the product demonstration, and provide post-demo feedback and report.  Requirements:  Fun, outgoing, RELIABLE, and sales-oriented. Share our passion about healthy living. You must provide your own small table and tablecloth, draw in customers, and you must be able to stand for 3 hours at a time. Reliable transportation required. Compensation - $20 per hour. (Demonstrations are 3 hours in duration).  Brief paragraph (why we should choose you!), and resume describing your promotional modeling, food demonstration, and/or sales experience. Mention if you hold a valid food handler certification. A recent picture of yourself.   If selected, you will be contacted directly.

We are seeking a mature and confident dog groomer for our veterinary practice.  We offer a flexible schedule, and plenty of independence.  We have a built in clientele and an equipped work space.  We provide the shampoos and you bring the scissors!  Compensation is based on a percentage of profit, so how much or how little you make is up to you.  If you like independence and plenty of room to grow your career, then this is the place for you.

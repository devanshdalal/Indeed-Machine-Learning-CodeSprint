Telecommute - You are not required to quit your existing job or relocate.  We are a community pharmacy that has been in existence for over 100 years. We have a great reputation and no disciplinary actions. We currently have several physicians in Kentucky that would like to refer to our pharmacy. But first, we must be licensed as an out-of-state pharmacy. In completing the application we noticed that it requires a KY licensed pharmacist. Our current PIC is looking into reciprocity but it will take some time. In the meantime, we are looking for a KY licensed pharmacist to help us complete the application process. We will pay a flat monthly amount until our pharmacist is licensed. You cannot have any prior disciplinary issues. Please apply if interested. We are looking to move forward with someone quickly.

At Rocky Mountain Care Transitional Rehabilitation, therapists communicate closely with the referring physician to customize a rehabilitation plan for each patient. The rehabilitation team includes Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Speech Therapy. The spacious therapy gym with state-of-the-art equipment, and a separate bathroom and kitchen for ADL training, provides patients with the tools to return to their prior living arrangement as quickly as possible. Our average length of stay is less than the national average by 5 days.  We also offer great opportunities to continue the care of our patients with home health services and out-patient services. This offers both the patient and therapist a diverse and comprehensive environment to promote maximal rehab potential for our clients.  We have a PRN OT position available at our Clearfield, Utah facility starting at the end of May and going for about 6-8 weeks. The candidate must be a certified OT.  Our building is located right by Davis Hospital with easy access to I-15. We just remodeled our entire location and we offer a truly beautiful place to work. We offer a great team to join, generous salaries, and endless career opportunities. Take a virtual tour at www.example.com. We are located at 1450 S 1500 E Clearfield, UT 84015.

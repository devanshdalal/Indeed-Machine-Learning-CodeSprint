WAI is a nationwide staffing agency for writers and trainers. Currently we are looking for a team of writers all across the United States.  This project will be to go to our client's locations and to review their procedure documentation for the billing department. Each location's level of existing documentation will vary. Some may just need edits and formatting and some may need to be worked on from near scratch status.   Our client needs candidates that are dispersed all over the US. This would require weekly travel and the duration is a bit unknown at this time. We are putting preliminary estimates at 2 weeks to a couple of months.   Candidates must have their own laptops with MSOffice as well as VISIO software. The bulk of the project will be reviewing their documentation and putting it into a standard template and style, creating process maps using flowcharts in VISIO and creating desktop procedures. This needs to be printable and delivered in one final binder (as well as electronic copies).

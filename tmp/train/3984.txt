Our client has a need for some document review attorneys for an ongoing project.  The additional attorneys could start as early as tomorrow (i.e., June 17, 2014).  The project is expected to last until the end of this month.  Candidates must have an active law license in any U.S. jurisdiction and be in good standing.  This is not a remote project.      Please send resume as a Microsoft Word or PDF document for consideration.    www.example.com

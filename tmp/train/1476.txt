Ask yourself – do you like to solve real problems by coming up with creative solutions using different security tools, especially SIEM and log management products? Because that's what we do. We’re not just another security consulting team; we’re a diverse group of people who love to solve problems. Whereas many companies sell the all-in-one security appliance to fix a company’s security challenges, we’re the security services company that goes in afterward to make sure those tools _actually_ solve the problem.    *Here's a quick quiz to give you an idea of the types of problems you'll be facing:*  *www.example.com  *If you don't submit answers for the link you won't be considered, so go to it and show off your skills!*   This role is ideal for someone with a year or two of security experience, but most of all who has a lot of passion.  We value enthusiasm and desire to learn but not necessarily experience - you'll get lots of that in this job.  What we love is for people who are looking to learn a lot and have a passion for doing something interesting, challenging, and at times a little on the bleeding edge of cool.   Who are you?   * Above all, you get things done. When given a task, you know how to execute to completion quickly and efficiently. (Like the above quiz!) * You're capable of working alone and have the ability to lead by example.   * You play well with others: you know who to ask for help _and_ when. And you know how to communicate effectively with a wide range of audiences. * You're relaxed under pressure: you have a positive attitude with the ability to handle stress in a productive way. * You're highly motivated by challenging work and won't give up. Sometimes, this work will be difficult. Sometimes it will seem impossible. You have to be motivated to solve hard problems quickly and with a smile on your face. * You motivate yourself: we're a virtual company. There's nobody who's going to stand over you and tell you what to do. Your manager will live in another state. * You know how to listen and learn: you can take constructive feedback from your peers and be open to change.  * You are legally able to work in the USA without sponsorship.   What will you do?   * Learn how new products work, and how they don’t, then show others how to use them effectively. * Use your collective knowledge of all things to solve customer problems. * Get a chance to see *many* neat places _all around the world_ in the process of doing the two items above, in other words, you'll be traveling about 75% of the time.  *Here's how you apply* : Take the assessment linked above! Then, when you're done come back here, hit the apply button and submit your resume and in the additional notes section let us know a little about yourself and *not* the typical robotic cover letter.  Make it read like an actual person wrote it :-)

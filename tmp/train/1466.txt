Very flexible, great rehab director and great work environment. Pretty much every therapist has family obligations and that is understood here. The rehab director is a nice person, ethical and responsive to his staff and their patient's needs. It is a team environment where the staff work together, get along, and help each other . The rehab department is in house and it is a family owned building. The building is set on 12 beautiful acres of land. They have been in business and have had a great reputation for 50 years. It has 229 beds and average about 50 short term residents. There is also have an extensive support network- 7 rehab aides for transport / help / reception. Productivity is set between 80% and 85%. Full-time employees >32 will be eligible for health care benefits â€“ premiums for employees extremely low and the insurance choices are major carriers. They offer 3 wks paid off, 4 personal holidays and 5 holidays as well as a 401K after one year. They offer numerous onsite offerings including hosting 2 courses in 2011 and a strong culture of education and provide education monthly within the department. They make education a priority in that department. MUST have a occupational therapist assistant license to practice as an OT assistant and must be certified to be an OT assistant.

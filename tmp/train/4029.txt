The Department of Global Health and Population at the Harvard School of Public Health/FXB Center Research Program on Children and Global Adversity (RPCGA) is seeking a post-doctoral Diversity Fellow applicant whose interests and career goals for training align with the activities of our recently-funded NIMHD R24 Community Based Participatory Research with Somali Bantu and Bhutanese refugees in Chelsea Massachusetts. The position will be based in Boston and involve intensive work with community partners.  Interested potential applicants with a background in quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods research skills (field-based survey data collection, parent and child survey administration, psychometric and multivariate analyses of child and family mental health outcomes) are encouraged to be in touch with Ms. Rochelle Frounfelker.  The RPCGA and the potential fellow will then work together to co-construct a proposal for funding to NIMHD comprising a two-year training and mentored research plan aligned with their career goals and project activities.   Applicants must come from an under-represented minority group (American Indian, Alaskan Native, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) and be U.S. citizens or green card holders. Willingness to spend significant time in participatory work with refugee populations as well as prior field based research in low resource and community settings is desired.

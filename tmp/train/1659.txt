HARC helps people with intellectual disability and their families enjoy lives of quality, inclusion and dignity by providing support, education, and advocacy.     HARC was founded in 1951 by a small group of parents whose mission was to address the challenges of intellectual disability. Years ago, when a child was identified as having intellectual disability, he or she was almost always referred to an institution. There were few, if any, programs or services available to help the child living at home.

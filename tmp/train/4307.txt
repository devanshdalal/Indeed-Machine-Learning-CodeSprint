WCC Furniture is one of the fastest growing furniture stores in the area. We are looking for a full time salaried salesperson to help customers select furniture and mattresses. We don't fight over \"ups\". We all work together to give the customer the best experience possible.  If you like to sell and work with people but don't like the pressure that comes with commission sales, please send us your resume. Salary and bonuses will add to about $32,000 to $40,000 for the 1st year. Advancement opportunities are available for our growing company. Sales experience is a plus but not required. 5 day work week. Must be able to work Saturdays. Off Sunday and one other day during the week.  If you feel like you would make a good team member, we'd love to hear from you. Please send us your resume OR drop it off at 300 Ridge Rd, Lafayette, LA.

We are seeking an enthusiastic candidate to fill a developmental position for a new medical office at the Memorial Southwest hospital.  The candidate would start off as either a receptionist or a medical assistant and then integrate administrative tasks into their work day.  The new team member would receive more hours and compensation as they grow with the practice. We will support any ideas or projects the teammate may have to improve the practice.  At the end of the day our goal is to deliver the highest level of patient care to our community and to have fun doing it.  The starting wage will depend on experience but the sky is the limit.

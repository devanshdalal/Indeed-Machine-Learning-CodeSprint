We are a leading fundraising company expanding to the east coast with immediate openings available for Account Managers in the northern N.J. area..   Our innovative programs offer a superior point-of-difference that provides our sales force a true competitive advantage, enhancing the opportunities to earn high commissions.  You will have a protected territory; furnished leads for your direction; and have the full company support to ensure your successful efforts.   You will be calling on schools, sports leagues, non-profit organizations, and any privately funded groups.  Knowledge of fund raising is not required, but sales experience is a definite plus.  You will be an independent sales agent compensated based on your sales. The commission structure is extremely lucrative with the strong potential to earn four figures a week.  If you are presently out of work, looking to change jobs, or your family’s secondary provider interested in supplementing your family’s income, this is a great opportunity worth exploring!  Please reply with a letter of introduction and resume.  We are scheduling interviews the week of July 22 and July 29. You will be notified of the time and place by return email.

Founded in 2010, Harmless Harvest is a progressive food & beverage initiative set to demonstrate that ecosystem-based business can out compete the conventional model. By integrating the long term welfare of all its stakeholders - from plant to customer - Harmless Harvest has taken the food and beverage world by storm- rising to the top of the industry in record time.  In 2011, we introduced the world’s first sustainably harvested, 100% raw, organic coconut water and are now one of the leaders of the category nationwide, and will soon launch a pioneering line of raw teas this Summer.  Combining innovative scientific methods with local traditional knowledge such as agroforestry, Harmless Harvest develops and manufactures products that actually deliver the nutritional and ethical integrity that others only promise.  By asserting tangible economic value to threatened ecosystems, Harmless Harvest protects these areas and their traditions.  With a marketing budget of $0, we are quickly elevating expectations for product quality by focusing the resources on the product not the promotion. Having grown exponentially in the last two years, we are consistently seeking to expand our team of passionate, driven entrepreneurs.  www.example.com  ------------ Harmless Harvest is looking for a Human Resources Manager to oversee integral needs of staff.

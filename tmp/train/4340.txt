We truly believe our success as a company is directly tied to our success in staying true to our founding premise.  In 1975, Loren Lebakken opened a Curtis Mathes Showroom in Rochester, Minnesota, at the time it was more retail then Rent-to-Own and consisted solely of electronics in its product line. In 1978, Rochester was devastated by a flood and the store was moved to La Crosse, Wisconsin.  It was shortly after the move that the realization was made that the business to be in was Rent-to-Own. The Curtis Mathes line was dropped in favor of a broader and more diversified product line. More stores were soon to follow, and currently there are eleven different stores open in Wisconsin with more stores planned for the future. Currently we have stores in La Crosse, Eau Claire, Schofield, Rhinelander, Tomah, Wisconsin Rapids, Shawano, Appleton, Green Bay, Rice Lake and Fond du Lac.  As family owned business with multiple store locations we are able to offer advancement opportunities.  *What is Rent-to-Own?*  The rental-purchase transaction is different from a retail credit sale in the following ways: * There is never any interest charged to the consumer * There is never any credit needed * There is no long term financial obligation  _Rental Options_  Lebakkens provides all customers with free replacement, free local delivery and free repair to defective items. Customers normally rent for one week, two weeks or one month at a time. At the end of each rental period, the customer always has three options to choose from:  1. They can terminate the rental agreement without any cost or obligation by simply returning the product. 2. They can renew the rental agreement by making another advance weekly or monthly payment 3. They may buy the item outright to save the most money.  _Purchase Options_  After a specified number of rental payments, ownership of the rented property is conveyed over to the customer. Lebakkens provides all customers with an early purchase option. This option allows all customers the choice to buy the rented property early and save valuable income.  *Facts About the Rental-Purchase Industry* Rent-to-Own has been an identifiable U.S. industry for close to 40 years The rent-to-own industry serves an average of 3.3 million customers per year. There are approximately 8,000 rent-to-own stores in the U.S.  www.example.com

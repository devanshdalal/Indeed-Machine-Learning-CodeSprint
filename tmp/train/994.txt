Leading market research firm is seeking a detailed-oriented employee for a full-time position.  This job requires multitasking, with three core functions: •  Coding of verbatim  responses from market research surveys into numeric  categories •  Data entry of surveys into pre-programmed formats •  Proof checking of text and data, to ensure that all analyses and reports maintain 100% accuracy and highest quality standards.  The person who will excel at this job will be someone…  - Who is a fanatic about details, and doing things “right” - Who loves to make order and sense out of non-connected things - Who loves being the first person to spot a blooper, omission, or mistake - Who hates misspelling, even on IM’s, texts and Facebook - Who sees meeting deadlines as a fun challenge rather than a stressful headache - Who likes being part of a team, and takes pride in the company's success   No specific education or prior experience is required, but you should be very comfortable with Excel and Word, and be excited rather than intimidated to learn new software programs.    This is an entry level position with an annual salary of $24.000.  If you think you are a match, please send us your resume.  If you have skills to add to this set, let us know about those too.    Most importantly, tell us something about yourself in a cover letter that will separate you from the crowd-- your job, your life experiences, and your goals.   We are looking to fill this opening very soon, and will respond to all applicants quickly.

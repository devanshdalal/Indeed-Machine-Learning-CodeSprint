Are you motivated by the things that you own or by what you’ve accomplished?  Of your four closest associates, where do you rate yourself?  What most impressed you about your mentor?  Why are you successful?  What is holding you back?  We want to get to know you.  So tell us how you feel about the above questions.  Tell us what you are seeking; tell us what’s important to you?  Are you that person, who we can trust to help run our business?   Do you share the same craving for success?   Are you seeking a long-term relationship?  This isn’t a job; this is an environment where you’ll spend your days.  This is the place you’ll talk about at dinner.  This is the place that has to be important – but not the most important place.

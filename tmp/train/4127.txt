Church in the Catonsville area looking for a person to do regular cleaning and light maintenance. Prefer someone who has a general knowledge of property maintenance potentially including grounds upkeep. This position would start as part-time and possibly as work by contract until it is determined that both parties are happy with the arrangement and further financial commitments could be meet. Days and hours are somewhat negotiable. The bulk of the work would be regular cleaning duties.(restrooms, trash removal, vacuum, ect.) Light maintenance would generally encompass light bulb replacement as needed, interior painting and overall upkeep of the grounds. Would be somewhat of a laid back atmosphere. Except on Sundays of course! Thanks for looking!

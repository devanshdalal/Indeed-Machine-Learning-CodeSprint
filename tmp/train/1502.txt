We're different than any other Real Estate company you'll ever encounter! Our company is based around the simple concept of family always being the most important aspect of anyone's life.  This principle resonates in our company from top to bottom. We work cooperatively instead of competitively to help each other out - so you never have to miss any of the special occasions in your children's lives like a soccer game, school play, or scout meeting.  Higgins Group agents don't compete with each other for clients, listings or awards. We want to see everyone succeed, so you'll never see \"top producer\" of the month or any other proclamations that make one agent look good at the expense of another. We have a history of attracting smart, creative, entrepreneurial people. Our cutting edge technology is second to none, and we are constantly trying to make ourselves even better. We offer a comprehensive Training program coupled with ongoing workshops and seminars to prepare agents for every possible scenario.  We grew from 1 agent, 1 office into 350 agents and 13 offices in less than 10 years - and we are still growing!   Any and all inquiries will be treated with the utmost discretion.

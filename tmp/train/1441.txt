A Fun Sales Manager Position!  We are a rapidly growing regional winery in the beginning of a significant growth phase. We have openings at all of our Main winery location in Shippenville and we invite you to attend our hiring forum below to give you the best possible insight into what we do and what we are looking for.

Following the presentation, if you are interested in pursuing this opportunity further, we will meet with you for a short interview.

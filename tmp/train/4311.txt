DemoChimp’s Media Creation Services team builds product demo videos for our customers that plug into DemoChimp’s intelligent product demo automation platform.   ABOUT DEMOCHIMP DemoChimp is software that automates product demonstrations so salespeople can service more prospects and close more deals and so marketing can convert more website visitors to leads. DemoChimp automatically configures a demo in response to each prospect’s unique needs, just like an expert salesperson. On your website, conversions increase as prospects interact with personalized content. Salespeople can see what each prospect says is important, so they know how to meet their unique needs. Salespeople can also track the demo as people share it within their organization, to discover and engage the entire buying panel. Managers access rolled-up analytics through a dashboard to gain product insights.  DemoChimp is currently located in Orem, UT but will soon be relocating to American Fork, UT.

Are you passionate about animals?  Can you approach people and build rapport easily?   Do you enjoy talking to others about your animals?   Can you work part-time on the weekends?     If you answered yes to the above questions, we would love to speak with you! We are looking for part-time \"Pet Detectives\" to join us in spreading the word and educating consumers about Blue Buffalo.    We are the Blue Buffalo Company - a company devoted to producing the finest and healthiest pet food available. Our products contain no corn, soy or wheat (known allergens to dogs and cats) and are full of healthy, holistic ingredients that fully support an animal's well being. A healthy animal is a happy animal!    The Pet Detective is a key role within the company. It is not the typical demonstrator/sales position. You won’t be pinned down at a demonstration table simply passing out coupons and samples and waiting for the next person to come along. You’ll have the luxury of roaming the entire store to talk with all sorts of concerned pet owners like yourself who are looking for the best information and products for their pets.    This is a steady, part-time position, so you can expect to have the opportunity to work each and every week. Full training is provided. We are looking for someone to work in both Cookeville and Crossville.    Our Requirements:    * True passion and love for animals – our number one requirement!    * Energetic, upbeat personality!     * Ability to approach people, strike up conversation and build rapport.    * Reliable transportation.    * Daily access to a computer and internet with a personal email address.    * High School Diploma preferred.

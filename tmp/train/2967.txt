The Meaike Agency is looking to expand the sales team. We are in Financial Services. We have clients all over the country sending in requests for Mortgage Protection Life Insurance. What we need is more individuals to help with servicing the request that are flowing in.  Your responsibility would be to call each request as it comes in to the system, book an appointment to drop off the information to the clients. You will be running the appointments and helping each family with fitting their needs as it pertains to their request.  Life Insurance is a powerful product, it helps to transfer wealth from generation to generation, it also makes sure that assets are protected before death such as a mortgage.  We work on commissions, the starting rate is 55%, that means you will earn an average of $550 per life application you get approved. We work with many different insurance companies so there is no reason why you would not be able to protect any of our clients.  We are interviewing nationwide so send your resume in now to be considered.

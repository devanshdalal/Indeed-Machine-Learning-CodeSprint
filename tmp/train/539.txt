The night auditor is a position filled with the responsibility of ending one day and beginning the next. To end one day, the night auditor must reconcile all transactions happening during the previous 24 hours by ‘closing out’ all pertinent data including, but not limited to, posting charges to rooms, checking guests in/or out of the resort, running an audit against those days’ records and verifying that figures have been entered correctly and completely. The night auditor’s duties also include the transmittal of collected monies to various bank accounts of the facility. The night auditor then begins the preliminary functions necessary to start the next day’s activities including the preparation of new arrival registration forms. The function of night auditor is to be absolutely sure that there is a smooth transition from one day to the next and to work with all the staff to insure that happening…indeed, the night auditor completes the circle he started 24 hours previously.

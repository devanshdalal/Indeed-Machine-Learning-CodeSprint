PT owned home care agency is seeking a physical therapist for full or part-time. You will kept in only three towns (East Haven, New Haven, and Hamden) whether you take full or part-time. Paperwork is very quick and easy and is paper rather than laptop. The drop off for paperwork is right in Hamden. Health, dental, and paid time off are offered. If you wish, you can get paid per visit and be guaranteed as many visits as you choose. Visits are 30 minutes minimum and driving is minimal since you will only be in three towns for all of your treatments (up to 30 treatments depending on your ideal scene).

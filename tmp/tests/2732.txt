They're willing to pay us a significant fee so they don't have to train and/or relocate someone.  Consequently, the referrals we make are held to a higher standard of industry specific experience, good track record (job stability) and proximity than might otherwise be the case. For example, Truckload Carriers want candidates with Truckload experience - not LTL. Domestic Air Freight clients frequently don't even want candidates with international AFF experience, much less people from the Steamship or Railroad industry. Shippers don't want Carrier personnel., etc.  This does not reflect on you personally. It's situational. No doubt, companies frequently hire candidates without the requisite experience on their own. They just don't do it through us.

If you've been in traditional medical or pharma sales, you already know that layoffs are common but loyalty to sales reps who produce…is not. At our lab, we take a different approach. Our focus is on building a long-term relationship with our growing  independent sales organization. We treat you with respect, and we pay above average commissions and bonuses.   Rather than building sales for a new company and always risk the pending layoff, if you're really good at sales, why not use your expertise and industry contacts to build a book of business that you can count on; one that can provide you with the potential to create much great earnings for you, while giving you more flexibility with your time and schedule.   We're a dynamic, growing, profitable laboratory, and we need you.   You're paid a percent of all received revenue from your accounts, for as long as your accounts are active. Work smarter, not harder, and make more with the residual commissions from your accounts.   (That means; no ride-alongs, no weekly activity reports, no mandatory meetings…we work with you as our sales partner.)  In this position, you bring the sales expertise, the industry contacts, the ability to sell to physicians.   We provide some of the highest commissions in the industry, along with fast cash performance bonuses to help you get started.   ‪The ideal candidates for this position will have experience in the laboratory industry - ideally in toxicology (either salaried or as a 1099 sales contractor), must be able to prospect and must be good at closing new business. You'll need to have a great attitude, be a quick study, and enjoy the thrill of the sale.‬   You also need to be ready to go to work, and be able to produce quickly. We have all the pieces in place for substantial expansion. We just need your skills and expertise.   This is a straight-commission, 1099 sale position. We offer substantial performance bonuses for new sales representatives, and we're with you every step of the way to help with your success.   Thanks for taking time to review our post. Please do contact us right away if you think we might be a fit.

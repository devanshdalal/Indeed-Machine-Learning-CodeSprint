We are looking for a bright individual who can assist us with SEO Copywriting for one of our start-up web properties (www.example.com). You don't need to be a professional copywriter (we'll teach you!), and you can be working full-time, part-time or moonlighting during the first 3 months. This is a great opportunity if you are trying to gain experience in the online marketing field, or if you have an entrepreneurial spirit and would like to work on an exciting project.   Although it's a non-paid internship, you WILL get equity after you get through the trial period (the first 3 months). Then, you'll be getting additional equity every 6 months based on performance until we become profitable (at which stage you can become salaried and work full-time).  Skills and qualities we are looking for: - Entrepreneurial mindset & positive attitude - Great content writing and editing skills - SEO experience preferred (but not required) - High School diploma or higher  If you think you are the person we are looking for, reply to this posting with your resume and cover letter (DO include cover letter). We look forward to hearing from you!

LaGrange College is seeking an experienced, highly qualified candidate to serve as the director of its ground-breaking Servant Scholars Program (SSP). This program focuses academic study on cooperative relationships with non-profit agencies within the local community to bring about constructive change. The directorship includes appointment to a 12-month, full-time, tenure-track position, with rank to be determined. Qualifications include a terminal degree in a field currently offered as a major by the college, as well as substantial experience in service-learning pedagogy and undergraduate research. Essential to the application is evidence of deep experience with servant leadership or selective honors programs. The application will be enhanced by evidence of experience in entrepreneurship programs or study-away curricula. Excellent oral and written communication skills and a commitment to the liberal arts mission of the college are expected. In addition to providing direction for the program, the successful candidateâ€™s duties will include teaching in both the SSP curriculum and in an existing major program, advising, continued scholarship, supervising of SSP internships, and service. Start date: 1 August 2013.    The Servant Scholars Program provides a focused, honors-like experience combining research, scholarship, and service for 12 juniors and 12 seniors (selected competitively, based on academic excellence, campus leadership, and community service). While completing this 18-credit-hour program, these students live in an historic apartment building, renovated in 2012 by a major foundation grant and located within walking distance of both the LaGrange College campus and the heart of downtown Lagrange, a community of 30,000. The goal of the program is to integrate the servant scholars into the community through collaboration with non-profit agencies and to support those agencies through innovative practices to address community problems and to improve the quality of life with the city and county. Internships are created with local organizations, with which the college hopes to have a demonstrable impact. During the course of their two years in the program, students determine a meaningful project addressing specific community issues. Students will be expected to provide reports to agencies and to the community at large, focusing on possible solutions to identified problems.

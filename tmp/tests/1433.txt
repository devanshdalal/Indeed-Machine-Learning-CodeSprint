Drafters work alongside an architect and use the architect's notes to ensure that the drawings the drafter creates accurately reflect what the architect had in mind for the final project.  Paying Attention to Scale you will:   Drafters have to pay careful attention to the scale of their drawing and the measurements that they specify for each part of the structure to ensure that it will look and function the way it is supposed to. Residential experience preferred.  Would prefer 2-3 years experience

Spin Transfer Technologies (www.example.com) is focused on the development of advanced magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) technologies and devices in collaboration with New York University researchers and industry partners.     The company is seeking a Senior Nanofabrication Engineer/Processing Engineering Manager to be a key member of its MRAM development team. This individual will be responsible for the design and implementation of process flows for the fabrication of prototype devices and large arrays of devices to advance development efforts. The successful candidate will work with a cross-organizational research and management team and be able to function independently in a startup environment. Some travel is required.     The position requires expertise in the processing of magnetic devices—including MTJ structures, magnetic sensors and/or spin-transfer devices—to lead a process development effort with the goal of achieving high device yields and optimized device characteristics. Duties include designing and implementing a robust lithographic process for MRAM device fabrication, realization of pattern and mask sets, and optimization of process parameters. The position will require extensive use of electron beam and optical lithography, etching tools and other standard processing tools.     The successful candidate will work closely with the MRAM development team and New York University researchers exchanging materials, devices and data toward realizing well-defined project milestones. The position is located at the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility (CNF) in Ithaca, New York     *Desired Skills & Experience*    • Experience with the fabrication of MRAM devices, magnetic sensors,and/or spin-transfer devices  • Etching: Recent hands-on experience with reactive ion etching (RIE) and/orion beam etching (IBE) of magnetic thin film stacks  • Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) processing and materials  • Lithography: Electron beam lithography, optical lithography, e-beam pattern and optical mask design, bilayer e-beam and optical resists, hard-mask techniques  • Inspection: Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy  • Thin film deposition: RF and DC sputtering, thermal and e-beam evaporation  • Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)  • Integration of magnetic devices with CMOS a plus  • Commercial process transfer and integration a plus     *Education/Other Requirements*  Applicants must have a minimum of a MS in Physics, Applied and Engineering Physics, Electrical Engineering or a closely related discipline and a minimum of five (5) years of practical nanofabrication experience and at least two (2) years of direct experience with processing of magnetic thin film devices. Demonstrated problem solving skills, and good communication and interpersonal skills are also essential.    *Company Description*  Spin Transfer Technologies is developing novel orthogonal spin transfer magnetoresistive random access memory (OST-MRAM™) technology for use in a wide range of stand-alone and embedded non-volatile memory applications. This technology has enormous implications for the development and commercialization of spin transfer MRAM devices, including faster switching times, lower power consumption, and scalability to smaller dimensions.  Spin Transfer Technologies is rapidly growing its team and expanding development facilities with major capital equipment.

Busy Animal Hospital in Glen Ellyn, is looking for a part time pet groomer.  Experience a plus but will take applicants right out of school. Must be dependable and work well with others. Cat grooming is a plus, but we will train. You will be required to do a test dog, before being hired. We are looking for part time 2-3 days a week including Saturdays, hopefully leading up to full time. Quantity of work is not as important than quality, we need someone who has good communication skills and can make a good client connection.   Reports to: Head Groomer, Office manager

We are looking for an Inbound Marketing Manager to manage our Hubspot marketing platform.   AnalyzeDirect is a medical technology company specializing in the worldwide sales, distribution and support of Analyze, a leading advanced visualization software product developed at Mayo Clinic. Our customers are physicians and scientists who work on research projects that involve analysis and visualization of medical images, including MRI, CT and nuclear medicine scans. We help our users to extract key information from their medical imaging datasets and achieve their research goals, enabling more treatments to be developed, more cures to be discovered, and more lives to be saved.  Our customers use the results generated with our software to publish articles in peer-reviewed scientific and medical journals. Hundreds of these articles are published each year in many different disciplines.  We use the Hubspot platform to provide educational content, based on our customer’s publications, to other physicians and scientists in these disciplines. We do this primarily through targeted keyword campaigns leading to keyword-focused blog posts and ebook publications. The responsibilities of this position include strategic planning, content creation and management, list management, creation of landing pages, calls to action, email campaigns, work flows, forms, template designs, social media publishing and monitoring…basically everything associated with successful Hubspot implementation.

JOB HEADLINE: Pharmaceutical Sales    COMP PLAN: 50K+ base salary plus bonuses and car. 75K to 85K first year. 110K by year three, track to 150K plus.    Are you a B2B or medical industry sales representative wanting an established customer base, a track to six figures and a fast career track leading to training and sales management? Put aside any preconceived notions you may have about Pharmaceutical Sales positions, as our client IS attracting, hiring and RETAINING B2B and medical sales professionals. If you have a college degree, at least two years of high performing, business to business or medical sales experience, and a strong desire to get into Pharmaceutical Sales, here are some highlights:    •There is a proven earnings track to six figures in as little as 36 months.  •Careers can fast track to specialty, training and sales management with incomes in the $150-200k range. Some of our hires have promoted in 18 to 24 months!  •Represent a company that has been in business – and profitable – for 50 years!  •You will call on a base of established physicians selling a set of well known and highly regarded cardiovascular and central nervous system pharmaceuticals.  •Low turnover: 94% of our near 300 hires have remained with this company – we have been placing B2B sales talent with them since 2003.  •This company fosters and trains a true sales environment – where sales are indeed “closed” and performance is financially rewarded.  •Contrary to the belief that a position in Pharmaceutical Sales cannot lead to a position in medical device, device manufacturers do recruit from this company.  •Very few leave this company to join other Pharmaceutical Sales companies; the other programs are just not as good.   •The company grows each year over the last, has NEVER had a lay off, and continues to launch anywhere from one to three new drugs per year.   •Generous benefits including medical, dental, eye, disability, 401K and stock plan, as well as generous vacation and time off policies.

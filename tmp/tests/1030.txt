Postdoctoral Fellow – Madagascar Biodiversity Genomics Job Description: Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Genetics Department (OHDZA-CG) based in Omaha, Nebraska is seeking a post-doctoral researcher with interest/expertise in the generation and analysis of next-generation sequencing data of lemurs, tortoises, and other taxa from Madagascar.  Duties: The successful applicant will construct genomic library for high throughput sequencing as well as assemble and analyze sequence data and manage next‐generation sequence workflows. This individual will be responsible for development, implementation, and support of software applications related to variant detection and interpretation from high-throughput experiments involving multiple species of lemurs, tortoises, and taxa from Madagascar. Interested candidates should be highly motivated, organized, independent, and have extensive experience with molecular genomics and bioinformatics. Travel to Madagascar to support the field programs of OHDZA-CG is required for a minimum of five week intervals twice a year.  Basic Qualifications: Applicants should hold a PhD in bioinformatics, computer science, molecular genomics or related field and have more than one year of experience in high‐throughput genome sequence analysis. Applicants should be experienced at software related to next generation sequencing data and be able to manipulate genomic data for phylogenetics and phylogeography. Our group’s focus is large-scale sequencing for phylogenetics, phylogeography and evolutionary studies of lemurs, tortoises and other taxa from Madagascar. Thus, previous experience in genome assemblies, annotation and analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) are preferable. The ideal candidate will be independent, highly motivated, productive, and able to work effectively in a team with members from a variety of diverse backgrounds with outstanding written and verbal communication skills. The successful applicant must be interested in interdisciplinary science and field research and have a solid publication record that illustrates ability to conduct novel, independent research.  *Must be legally entitled to work in the USA. Visa sponsorship is not available at present.*  Preferred Qualifications Candidates should have 3+ years of experience in molecular biology, genetics, or bioinformatics. The position requires proficiency in programming (Perl, C++) and Linus operating systems. Applicants are also expected to be familiar with bioinformatics tools and genomics databases and have extensive and creditable laboratory experience with constructing genomic libraries.  Appointment: The selected candidate will be based primarily at OHDZA-CG, but the individual will be required to travel and conduct field work with the projects under the management of the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership, ONG (www.example.com). Salary/benefits are based on OHDZA-CG’s salary/benefits structure, and are commensurate with experience. The initial appointment is for duration of two‐years, but is renewable for an additional two years based on performance.  Application: Applicants should send curriculum vitae, a statement of research interests and career goals, and the names and addresses of three academic references to: Dr. Edward E. Louis, Director of Genetics department, Center for Conservation and Research, Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, 3701 South 10th Street, Omaha, NE 68107; Email: edlo AT omahazoo DOT com; genetics AT omahazoo DOT com  Review of applications will begin on July 15, 2013 and the position selected by August 1, 2013. The position will begin on September 1, 2013.

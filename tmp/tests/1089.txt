The Rapid Learning Institute (RLI) is looking for an experienced writer who combines two skills:     1. Subject matter expertise in either Management/Leadership or Sales     2. The ability to write compelling 6- to 10-minute training modules.  We’re a fast-growing company and this is a great opportunity with high earnings potential for the right person. You’ll be part of a very collaborative editorial team. You’ll be challenged like you’ve never been challenged before. And you’ll learn to do something few writers can pull off – identify a narrow learning concept, bring it alive in a compelling narrative, and leave learners with a single “aha” they can deploy immediately on the job.   Some people think that’s sounds easy. Trust us, it’s not.    Requirements:  1. Several years of professional writing experience – in journalism, advertising, PR, broadcast, corporate communications, creating training content, or something else. If no one has ever paid you to write for an extended period of time, it’s unlikely you’re qualified for this position  2. One of the following:      a. At least two years of Sales experience where you learned how to deal with rejection and    failure, and had your share of triumphs, or     b. At least two years of Management/Leadership experience where you were directly responsible for most or all of the following: : • training and development • motivating people • setting goals and holding people accountable • employee discipline • conducting performance and salary reviews • hiring and firing    3. Willingness to take a challenging writing test to show us what you can do. It will require that you do three things:        a. Watch several of our modules to understand the format       b. Read two research studies that we’ll provide       c. Draft a 1200- to 1500-word script that illustrates the concept explained in the research  If you can write a script that delights us, you’ll be a strong candidate for a very exciting writing job.

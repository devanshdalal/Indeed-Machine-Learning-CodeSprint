Constellation Pharmaceuticals leverages insights from the rapidly expanding field of epigenetics to discover and develop small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory/immunologic disorders and other diseases. Research here and by others has shown that abnormal epigenetic regulation of gene expression contributes to many different diseases. Our innovative product discovery engine targets both the enzymes that modify the dynamic structure of chromatin and other proteins that interact with chromatin to control gene expression.     The Department of Biology seeks a motivated and experienced Scientist to conduct target identification and validation-related research to support drug discovery in a highly collaborative, goal-oriented, fast-paced team environment. The position requires expertise in cancer cell biology and/or chromatin biology and a passion to do high quality scientific research.    Responsibilities  • Primarily responsible for design and execution of experiments to understand the mechanism of target action in the context of disease-relevant molecular pathways and to prioritize targets for our oncology drug discovery pipeline.   • Contribute to the evolution of our drug discovery platform through the implementation of new technologies and support the company’s infrastructure needs with regard to tools used in cancer and/or chromatin biology.   • Active interaction and collaboration with other project team scientists.     Requirements:  • Ph.D. in life sciences with emphasis on cancer biology or chromatin biology with 1-3 years of work experience  • Broad knowledge and expertise in oncology including epigenetics and cell signaling as demonstrated by peer-reviewed publications.   • Flexibility to work across diverse areas, ability to develop and evaluate novel assays for a wide variety of biological/phenotypic endpoints.  • Strong oral and written communication skills, keeping good scientific record, writing reports and giving updates at team meetings is required.  • Detail oriented, self-motivated, resourceful, with the ability and desire to work in a challenging dynamic environment under tight deadlines is required.  Key Skills:  • In depth knowledge of cell biology and molecular biology techniques including chromatin immunoprecipitation, cell transfection (cDNA, siRNA and shRNA), stable cell clone generation, cloning/mutagenesis.  • Familiarity with high-throughput biology assay development and execution, sequencing technologies, genomic library preparation and data analysis.  • Experience with -3D and -2D cancer model systems to study the role of key genes/proteins in cancer, and using high throughput fluorescence and luminescence based readouts for functional endpoint screening is preferred.    Constellation Pharmaceuticals is an Equal Opportunity Employer and a participant in E-Verify, and offers a comprehensive benefits package, including health, dental, 401(k), paid vacation, tuition reimbursement, and much more.

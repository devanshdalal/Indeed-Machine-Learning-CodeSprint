We are a computer cart manufacturer and distributor located in Florida. We have customers who use our products (mostly schools & districts) that need tech support from time to time. The job will be on a as needed basis, this is not a full time position. We are looking for someone who is reliable, has their own transportation and would not mind traveling out of the state if necessary. This would be the perfect opportunity for someone who is retired or just looking for small projects here and there and is mechanically inclined or has the background and would like to make a little extra cash. We will interview the top 3-4 most qualified people. Please respond with your resume and availability. Drug testing and background checks will be performed.

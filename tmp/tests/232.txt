Hello,  We are in need of some staff additions in our ship yard for our gardening supply wholesale company. We are coming into our busy season now that Spring is here and would like some help in our ship yard. You position here would require a few different elements:  -We need people that can make deliveries (i.e. having a valid driver's license)  -Are ok with heavy lifting (no pre-existing back injuries please) as per we have a soil yard and a full scale nutrient/fertilizer inventory room...forklift experience is not required but would help very much in your opportunity to work here :-) -Bilingual would make your resume jump to the top of our call back list :-) we have a very diverse staff here  -Work hours may include 9-5 sometimes 8-6 depending, a flexible work schedule is necessary -Organization skills, taking initiative  -This position has opportunity for a managerial position. If you have manager's experience, please note so on your resume (needs to be at least a year of experience or more with references).  We need a team player :-) we would like someone that can manage stress levels well and take initiative in situations where one may need to prioritize.  Efficiency is key, doing the job right the first time and taking direction in a fast paced environment is a skill set that we are definitely looking for (as well as applying constructive criticism, we feel that there is always room for improvement).   We have all types of orders that come in throughout the day that need to be filled, occasionally one may fall into a \"more urgent\" category than another so a flexible personality is essential. This is also where organization skills come in, being able to pause a project and come back to it may happen frequently here.  If this sounds like a position that may be right for you, please email your resume and any other notes that you feel should be taken into consideration while we review your submissions. We are located in Santa Rosa, California. Please call for an appointment first, no walks ins please. We usually call back within a week if we feel that your skills may be the ones we are looking for.   Thank you for your time, happy gardening!  By appointment only please, we will contact you if we are interested.  Thank you, Best of Luck

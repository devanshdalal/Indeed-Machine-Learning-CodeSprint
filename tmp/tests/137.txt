POSITION DESCRIPTION  This position is a Mechanical Engineer Design Position for a company which provides battery powered LED technical lighting systems for recreational purposes and portable consumer lighting/electronics products.  This is a “hands-on” position.  MUST HAVE EXCELLENT SOLIDWORKS 3D MODELING SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE WITHIN PAST 5 YEARS.    ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES    • Responsible for conceiving, designing, and producing innovative new lighting products.  • Lead the mechanical design of consumer lighting products from concept to production.  • Work with marketing and sales to create and document clear product targets including target cost and functional specifications.  • Assist in developing the project schedule, development budget, and resource plans for new products.  • Work closely with Industrial Designers and Electrical Engineers on concept realization and feasibility using sketches, Solid Works modeling, and quick turn prototyping.  • Develop elegant and robust mechanical solutions for product concepts with tight spatial constraints, mechanisms, integrated electronics, and complex organic surfacing.  • Design and have built 3D models for testing, proof-of-concept, mock-ups, working prototypes, and functional appearance models.  Building proof of concept models to verify designs.  • Discovery and development of materials, processes and cutting-edge technologies for application into new and existing products.  • Research potential technology suppliers/partners that could enable new products.  • Use engineering analysis and simulation to design in product quality in the early design stages and reduce iteration and issues during new product introduction.  Build and validate prototypes.  • Translate concept solutions into manufacturable and cost effective detailed designs.  • Work closely with outside contract electrical design teams to create PCB outline drawings that integrate and control mechanical and electrical requirements.  • Identify and manage critical path actions, risk items, and issues.  Create design documentation for release to manufacturing including bill of materials and part/assembly drawings.    • Support design through production tooling, qualification testing, production processes, and manufacturing introduction.    • Stay current on technology, industry, and consumer trends and identify ideas for new products or enhancements to existing products and provide input to the Sales Department and Management Team.     REQUIREMENTS:    • Must have a BS or MS in Mechanical Engineering and at least 10 years experience in related mechanical product design.  • Must have proven record of successfully commercializing innovative designs and processes.  • Must have current Solid Works CAD experience with strong surfacing skills and very knowlegable in the use of Solid Works with a minimum of 7 years experience in using Solid Works.  • Must have plastics injection molding experience and experience in part design for mold ability. Should have injection tool design knowledge.  • Experience with advanced plastics and alternate materials.  • Experience in metal part (die cast aluminum) design and associated mass production processes.  • Should have experience working with overseas product development and manufacturing.  • Should have experience with electronic enclosure design for high volume portable consumer lighting/electronics products and retail market.  • Should have excellent analytical skills including heat transfer, thermal, and stress analysis.  • Should be familiar with the characteristics of a wide variety of metal and plastic materials.   • Must have mechanism and spring design experience.  • Technical skills must be current (used extensively for past three years).  • Understanding of PLM documentation management for part number, BOM, and engineering change creation.  • Enthusiastic, hands on, and extremely organized, project driver with a strong desire to own fast paced development programs.    • Fearless problem solver and multitasking capable.    • Passion for technology and a relentless drive for success and high quality engineering.    • Requires some travel to overseas suppliers to ensure product quality and validation of manufacturing processes.    PLUS FACTORS:  • Knowledge of LED lighting technology and/or optical design.  • Previous experience and knowledge of battery chemistries.  • Being a cycling or off-road enthusiast.

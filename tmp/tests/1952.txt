Custom Home Health is a rapidly growing home health agency in need of excellent Physical Therapists. Custom Home Health was just awarded the second best place to work in Michigan as well as the top home care company to work for by the Detroit Free Press. Our compensation is at the top of the industry because we value our clinicians as partners in developing our business. We are a small, caring company that values and supports our team in the field.  We have a large base of orthopedic care patients in all areas and hire PTs only, which means no requirements for supervision. Home health experience is preferred, but we are most interested in an 'above and beyond' attitude and will train PTs who are ready for the independence and autonomy of home health care.  Our therapy director, Barb Samson, OT welcomes your call to talk further about employment opportunities at  XXX   Please send your resume or CV by fax to  XXX  and we look forward to hearing from you!

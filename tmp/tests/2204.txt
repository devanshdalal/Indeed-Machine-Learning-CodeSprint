We are in need of a couple of Hard Working, Energetic, Happy Employees! We have a 6000 sq foot Indoor Play Parent Caf√© and Boutique.   *Bilingual Spanish/English is a MUST *Experience in Early Education or Preschool would be great. *I need a self starter, who is a clean freak, is personable and loves kids. *We cater to parents with infants to toddlers so a child spirit is welcomed. :) *We need part time employees who have the ability to work weekdays and some weekends for a couple of hours when we have a party.  Qualities my best employee has:   Always caring and taking care of me and my business. She is putting stuff away, cleaning, organizing the Boutique, and is willing to go above and beyond it being just a 'job'  Pet peeves of past employees who weren't employees for long:   Standing around doing nothing and looking into space, waiting for me to have a spare moment, which I never have, to ask me what exactly I want them to do.. Using their cellphone on MY time.. NOT!, Seeing kids doing things that they are not supposed to be doing even potential dangers for the children but not having the care to go and fix it.  If you feel you would be a good match, please email me your resume and contact info.  attn: Mark and Angelica    *NO PHONE CALLS. WE ARE EXTREMELY BUSY. ONLY EMAILS ACCEPTED*

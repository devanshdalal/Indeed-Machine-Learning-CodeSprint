*WANTED*  *Future Rock Stars*  No experience necessary   Over 20 years ago, I was noodling for a new business idea.  Having started numerous entrepreneurial concepts in the past, several of which were absolute disasters, I stumbled onto the idea to sell and rent used exercise gear.  Realizing that in my world, a niche or hook is extremely important in the game of consumer retailing, this concept appeared to have legs.  At that time, the only option available for purchase was new equipment sold at a variety of mass merchants and a few specialty fitness stores.  Bingo, my simple idea became a reality.   On March 7th 1992, 2nd Wind Exercise Equipment opened its doors with a wild selection of clothes racks, dust collectors, and door stops scavenged by me cruising garage sales and scouring the classifieds. (No Craigslist at that time).  The first location in South Minneapolis was a small (1,500 sq. ft.) joint that had the look of a flea market of discarded exercise junk.  With clever gorilla marketing, the idea began to gain traction.  Year-end 1992 we had two locations and $450,000 in sales.   As the number of locations grew, sourcing a reliable supply of used goods became a real challenge, and I was forced to pursue manufacturers of new equipment. This important decision warranted an addition to the incredibly successful marketing slogan, “Why Buy New When Slightly Used Will Do” “Except When the Deals Are This Good”.  Fast forward the clock to fifteen years later (2007).  2nd Wind had grown to 100 locations operating in nine Midwest states with annual sales exceeding $95,000,000.  Needless to say, a bunch of Rock Stars were born during this run, most of which are still with us today.  It isn’t necessary to dwell on the past and current economic challenges businesses are dealing with today.  Understandably, 2nd Wind didn’t qualify for an exclusion and appropriately elected to “right” size the company.  After many major concessions and necessary painful changes, it’s six years later and we are “pumped up” and ready to crank up the action again.  The purpose of this ad, good people make great companies.  You could be our next ROCK STAR.   *REQUIREMENTS*  1.       Incredible heart and a passion to succeed.  No pretenders.  2.       Possessing a strong fitness background is a major plus.  3.       Previous sales experience preferred, but not necessary.  4.       Open mind and willing to follow a proven success program.  5.       Superb communication skills along with a team player attitude.  6.       Must be capable of putting “points on the board”.  7.       Most importantly, absolutely financially driven. No exceptions.  If the above description is a snapshot of you, let’s talk.  Fire off a current resume and a “letter of conviction” detailing your credentials as to why 2nd Wind should consider you for this exciting opportunity.  Who knows, the next 10 days could change your life forever.  Future Rock Star applicants should submit their resume and “letter of conviction”.  \"It is the policy of 2nd Wind Exercise Equipment to provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, religion, color, ethnic origin, gender, age, marital status, veteran status, sexual orientation, disability, or any other basis prohibited by applicable federal, state, or local law.\"

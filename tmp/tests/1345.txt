Edward Mindlin Co. is a sole proprietorship based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Owner Eddy Mindlin is a manufacturers' representative of commercial flooring products and covers New Mexico and West Texas. He is looking for a sales associate that lives in the Lubbock area to cover West Texas (Amarillo, Lubbock, & Midland/Odessa). Associate will make sales calls on architects, interior designers, and facility managers of buildings such as schools, hospitals, recreation centers, and churches. This is a straight commission sales position and salesperson will be an Independent Contractor. Salesperson will set their own hours. No overnight travel. Eddy will visit several times per year to make sales calls with the associate and will always be available to assist via phone and email.  The ideal candidate will have a bachelor's degree or equivalent work experience. Associate must be organized, have the ability to keep track of projects and follow up, outgoing, and enjoy meeting people. Product knowledge is the easy part and Eddy will help with that. There is very little competition in West Texas as few sales representatives actually live in the area. The associate will have a huge advantage by being local.  Associate will be paid 50% of the commission on all projects in and near Amarillo, Lubbock, and Midland/Odessa. A hard working associate would be expected to make a minimum of $40,000 per year by the second year and could make up to $80,000.

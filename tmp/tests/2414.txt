DO YOU LOVE AND ATTEND THE MOVIES (at the theatre) AT LEAST 3-4 times per month (no less)? DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE A FILM-BUFF (or at least love movies)?   CinemaScore is looking for 2 outgoing, reliable people to conduct market research, by handing out exit-survey ballots to movie-goers at the theatre on opening night. We would prefer to find a duo/couple (i.e. you and a partner) to poll, rather than someone who intends to poll alone. Experience has shown us that pollsters who bring a partner tend to find this job more fun...and easier!  If interested, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE FULL AD BEFORE RESPONDING, as there are specific instructions (we cannot consider anyone who does not READ this ad thoroughly). Please also make sure you only respond if you GO OUT to the movies AT LEAST 4 times a month!!   Please see the website BEFORE responding: www.example.com  Job description:  As pollsters, you and your partner will provide movie-goers with survey ballots INSIDE selected movie theaters, approx. 2 Friday evenings per month. This simply entails handing each moviegoer a small (POCKET SIZE ) rating ballot as they enter the auditorium, and collecting the ballots from the moviegoers at the end of the movie (NO PENCILS NEEDED!!). Results are then written out as number-codes (\"scored\") and sent to our head office that evening. Most pollsters start around 6:30pm (depending on what time the film begins), and finish after they collect the ballots at the end of the movie and write out the results. Writing out the results takes approx./average of 45mins.., So you're only actually \"working \" about 2 hours.  Understand that you will NOT be giving YOUR opinion. You will be handing out ballots to people attending the films, so that THEY can give THEIR opinions.   HERE'S THE BEST PART:  Pollsters (you and your partner/pal/spouse, etc.) are always welcome (but NOT required) to watch the film for free in the process. Films are all MAJOR HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER RELEASES on opening night. Imagine keeping up with the latest films, while earning money in the process! If hired, you'll be paid $60.00 per movie polled, plus watch the movie for free if desired...and lets face it, movies are expensive today! Generally, you would be scheduled an average of 2 movies per month.  THIS IS NOT A TEMPORARY/\"STUDENT\" POSITION. We are looking for a pair who intend to become permanent. If you tend to go to movies with someone else (spouse, significant other, friend/s, etc.), you are strongly encouraged to inquire! Retirees are also encouraged! Preference will be given to PAIRS/COUPLES, rather than someone polling solo, so if you have a pal in mind, be prepared to bring them along if we meet!  Requirements:  - MUST POSSESS A LOVE OF MOVIES; MUST ALREADY BE ATTENDING THE MOVIES (at a movie theatre, not at home!) AT LEAST 4 TIMES A MONTH!  ...strongly PREFER a team-of-2, rather than an independent pollster. *-MUST BE ABLE TO MEET/INTERVIEW briefly in the Dallas area* - Must live in the Dallas area.  - Must be honest and responsible adults, with a willingness to poll 2 Friday evenings per month.  - If currently employed during the day, your schedule must allow arriving at the movie theater on time, one hour prior to the start of the movie.  - Must be outgoing (or at least assertive enough to approach movie-goers).  - Must be able to send results either by smart-phone (picture/text), or via fax/scanner/email.  - If hired, we will train you...no related experience necessary.   A representative from CinemaScore will be out there briefly meeting with people individually by appt., during the week of 1/27/14. Some initial phone calls will take place next week...we need to hire one main couple/duo, and one back-up couple/duo.   Please understand that we are overwhelmed with several cities and may not get to everyone!   Interested? Please make sure to provide: . A PHONE NUMBER WHERE YOU CAN BE REACHED. . Mention how often you go OUT to the movies. . The last 3 movies you saw in the THEATRE (not rented!).  (hint: bare in mind that if you don't give us an idea of who you are and why you're right for the position, your email might accidentally overlooked.

*Opportunity:* Slumber Parties consultants are partying for a living and so can you.  We are one of the fastest growing adult party businesses in the world today offering in-home parties exclusively for adult women. Our consultants have found that “romance enhancement” products are in high demand and the parties fit perfectly into their lives and schedules; allowing them much needed “girl time” with the added perk of earning a great income.   *Freedom:* What’s your idea of Full-time or Part- time?  Slumber Parties offers the freedom to become financially independent, the freedom to make your own flexible schedule, the freedom to stay home with your family and the freedom to get out of the house.  Who said we had to work 40 hours a week?  It certainly wasn’t a Slumber Parties consultant!  *Free Training:* You can always feel confident about your business.  As a consultant, your career is your own, but you will never be alone.  Help is just a phone call or a click away.  Fellow Consultants are ready to help anytime along with corporate support to assist with every aspect of your business.  We also host at least two corporate events each year that offer classes designed to help better any Slumber Parties business.  We don’t just say, “Live the Fantasy”; we make sure you have everything available so you actually LIVE YOUR FANTASY.  *More Information:* Feel free to browse through our website and learn about Slumber Parties 20 year history and inspiring philosophy.  We are among the best of the best in the adult home party industry and have established a solid success plan.  As other companies have struggled through these trying economic times, Slumber Parties has maintained an ever-increasing consultant and client base; making this a business venture worth checking out!    *E-Mail Holly Bates at example@example.com for more information.*

Who we are:    An award-winning marketing innovations company that specializes in brand activation, entertainment marketing, product & package development and consumer promotions for little clients like Disney, Southwest Airlines and Microsoft.    Who you are:    An experienced Account Service professional that will serve as a liaison between client & creative services and ensure flawless execution on project work.  You OWN delegated projects (project organization, timeline creation & management and job direction to other departments).  You’re also good with numbers; you’ve established and managed budgets of all sizes.      What you’ll be doing instead of being on Facebook:    * Developing, managing and executing client programs while you are: scheduling workflow and creating timelines, interpreting client direction to write superior creative briefs, and knowing how to handle yourself during client meetings (whether on the phone or face-to-face)  * Playing an active role in developing & maintaining client relationships as the primary point of contact for our projects   * Understanding available marketing tools and tactics   * Knowing the roles of creative and production and where they fit in to the project execution process  * Adding & subtracting:  estimating time and costs, written estimates, cost-to-dates/tracking, invoices   * Becoming an expert in the industry of each of your clients  * Providing consistent updates on all account activity, including status and call reports on a weekly basis  * If no one is around, you might have to put paper in the printer    You need to have:    * An extremely positive attitude, fearless sense of adventure and insatiable inquisitive nature (or at least 2 out of 3)  * A strategic mind and ability to communicate that strategy to clients  * Empathy for your consumer, your client and your co-workers (not necessarily in that order)  * Bachelor’s Degree in advertising, marketing or a related field, 3-5 yrs. agency experience and/or client CPG – triple MBA bonus points   * Proven account management skills required in order to create, maintain and enhance customer relationships  * A highly detail-oriented and organized work ethic  * MAC experience and an above average knowledge of Microsoft Office (especially Excel & PowerPoint)   * The aptitude to Google something in less than 5 seconds…meaning you know how to seek knowledge if you don’t already have it  * A high level of motivation and negotiating skills  * The ability to keep your cool when you’re on a deadline  * An ego that can be checked at the door – we really are team players  * A take-charge attitude and the ability to think independently when necessary  * Excellent written and oral communication skills  * A sense of humor and just a little bit of crazy – because we’re a little crazy      What’s in it for you:    A competitive salary including results-driven bonuses with a privately held, growing company chock full of passionate people that do better work than anyone we compete against.   Really.  We’re not kidding.    Oh yeah, we offer medical/dental/vision, 401K, paid vacation…and other wicked awesome perks like a free-for-all day at the Texas State Fair and yearly Maryland Blue Crab feasts.   We’re not kidding about that, either.    Submit your resume and a cleverly written cover letter (including salary requirement).  Any submissions that do not include salary requirement (or a cover letter) will be summarily set on fire while our creative team does a tribal voodoo dance around it and sacrifices old concept work.

*Attention: this position for experienced insurance sales professionals only.  Please do not apply unless you have proven sales experience.*  *Location: Fort Myers, FL and surrounding areas*  Why do so many independent agencies make it so hard for agents to be successful? They just can’t seem to get out of their own way.    It’s not that hard.  We’re not building a lunar rover here (or, for the more youthful set, creating the next Instagram).    Redbird Advisors is a fast-growing, independent agency that specializes in final expense life insurance for the senior market ages 50-85.  We offer agents a simple, straightforward and honest approach to enable agents to build successful independent businesses: • Products from A-rated carriers • Strong commissions with opportunities for increases based on production  • Opportunities to build a team and become a manager • Agents contracted directly with carriers to ensure fast commission payment • Selling support in the right places/at the right times,  • Renewals are the agent’s from day one  • A brand that delivers added value • And then we get out of the way.  Repeat: it’s not that hard!   We are looking for *independent-minded* agents (whether captive or independent today) to grow our regional teams across the Midwest and Southeast.  The successful Redbird agent is passionately independent and thrives in an environment where they have control of the outcome.  If you want to take next week off, you take it off.  If the kids have activities, you go to them.  The ideal candidate must have proven sales experience, ideally 3+ years.  Insurance or financial services experience a plus.  Six figure incomes are the norm for those that work within our lead system.    Speaking of that lead program… if there is a special sauce to our success it is our in-house, proven direct mail lead system.  Sharpened for almost a decade, our approach utilizes tried and true direct mail techniques that consistently generate a 1-2% response rate. “Only 1-2%,” you say?  Well, unless you’re giving away free stuff, 1-2% is historically what consumer direct mail returns.    Here’s how it works.   We work with one of the best list development companies in the U.S.  With their data we work directly with our agents to identify territories in which they will sell.  We never sell the same list to other agents; OUR LEADS ARE FOR OUR AGENTS ONLY.  Letters are mailed to targeted seniors who respond by filling out a postage paid return card, which is in your hands immediately after it’s received.  So, when you call them they are expecting your call and are happy to hear from you.    *Visit our website—www.example.com download an overview of the opportunity (link at top right of home page).*  We look forward to hearing from you.

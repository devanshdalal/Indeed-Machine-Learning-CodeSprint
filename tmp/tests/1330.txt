The internationally acclaimed renegade design studio, Unknown Fields Division, is  looking for 2  drivers that are available to drive our Thomas school bus for us for a 2-3 week period in august for a study trip we are organising driving from Denver via Phoenix to San Francisco.  We are a group of architects, designers, artists and generally creative types and we are looking for flexible fun loving but reliable drivers willing to join an adventure with us across the states on a tour of military infrastructure, alien landscapes and UFO conspiracies . Applicants ideally have experience of driving a 70 seater school bus, hold a CDL licence and have at least 1yr experience. The people we are looking for should be willing to be flexible and to get into the spirit of things!  We can pay a modest fee [to be negotiated] and cover expenses but would not be able to pay full commercial rates as it is an educational trip. But this trip will be a real experience and something totally out of the ordinary for someone looking for an adventure.   The dates are 15th August - 3rd September for one driver from Denver to SF and 17th August - 30th August for the 2nd driver from ABQ to Reno   Please see the web link below for more details of what we do.     www.example.com

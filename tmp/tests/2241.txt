*The Job*  The citizen science department at the Adler planetarium is seeking an experienced technical project manager to be responsible for coordinating the efforts of our Chicago-based web team and delivering new projects for the Zooniverse (www.example.com), home to the web's best and most popular citizen science projects.  *Who we are*  We're a small group of developers, educators, and scientists based at the Adler Planetarium, creating online citizen science web apps that change the world. Though we work on a peninsula in the middle of a lake (with the best views in Chicago!), our work is not insular. We collaborate with the Adler's education, astronomy, public programs, and experience design departments; we partner with world-leading universities and research institutions from Tanzania to Tokyo; and our websites are visited by hundreds of thousands of passionate citizen scientists from more than 195 countries.  *What we do*  We take huge quantities of scientific data and create web apps that allow people to make a real contribution to scientific research. Our projects contribute to research in zoology, astronomy, climatology, and more. Just a sampling of our projects enable our web visitors to find new planets, listen to bat calls, classify distant galaxies, track animals in the Serengeti, transcribe WWI ships' weather records, and monitor for extraterrestrial radio signals.  *Who you are*  As an experienced technical/web project manager you'll know how to estimate the design and development effort required for a project. Although you may not be a developer by trade you understand what web development work looks like. You have a good instinct for when a problem is hard and when it's not. You know when to trust your technical team to develop the right solution and when to re-scope because the development timeline is slipping. You believe that process is important but understand that each team is different.  You're a master communicator and are capable of maintaining multiple simultaneous conversations with designers, developers and clients (in our case scientists). With a command of the full lifecycle of web development you're comfortable allocating team resources appropriately and planning a development timelines.  *Are we a good fit for each other?*  If we're who you want and you're who we want, let's chat!  *To apply please visit:*  www.example.com  Equal Opportunity Employer M/F/D/V  â€‹REQ: ZOO140

bs-degree-needed	Contract role-- 3 to 6 month engagements with possibility to extend.  Axiom, a new model professional services firm in the legal industry, is currently interviewing operations analysts and paralegals with financial services experience who are seeking placement on complex, short-term legal projects out of our New York office.    Who We Are   Founded in 2000, Axiom saw the need to rethink the way legal services were delivered. Today, Axiom comprises a team of 1,000 across 11 client service offices and 4 delivery centers on 3 continents and has grown at 50%+ CAGR since inception. Axiom serves nearly half of the F100, and has 90% client retention. Our clients include Cisco, Google, Honeywell, NBC, Avon, Yahoo! and many of the world’s largest financial institutions.    Driving much of this growth is Axiom’s Managed Services division—a recognized pioneer in delivering Managed Legal Solutions.  The Legal and Compliance industries have historically lacked a delivery model that integrates both legal know-how and operational excellence. In-house departments tend to be sub-scale, law firms lack process DNA, and traditional BPO providers lack legal know-how. Axiom’s process and technology-driven model delivers legal and compliance processes with tighter risk management and better service at a lower cost.   In recognition of the above, The Financial Times’ 2012 Innovative Lawyers Report recognized Axiom as the leader in “The Business of Law” and “The Most Innovative Firm in Corporate Strategy.” Axiom’s unique approach has also been recognized by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Forbes, and BBC. For more information, please visit our website, www.example.com. What We’re Looking For   This position is ideal for someone with an entrepreneurial mindset, goal orientation and a demonstrated pattern of strong, practical problem-solving skills in an operations or paralegal role at a major financial services institution. Given that the role is for short-term, project-based work, a demonstrated ability to hit the ground running and adapt quickly to new professional environments is imperative.     This position is based out of our New York office.    Experience & Qualifications   • 2+ years in an operations or paralegal role at a major financial services institution.  • Experience in one or more of the following substantive areas:  o Document management;  o Capturing, analyzing, and reviewing new trade events (trade processing);  o Settling/clearing transactions;  o Checking systems to ensure proper data flow from the front office to the back office;  o Confirmation;  o Settlement;  o Fail management;  o Margin asset servicing;  o Risk management;  o Monitoring transactional activity;  o Investigating/reporting suspicious activity; and o Making process improvements to existing technology. • Meticulous attention to detail   • Proficiency with Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, PowerPoint, Word) • Exposure to derivatives products and documentation a plus • Relentless focus on client’s needs, consistently raising the bar on service excellence • Superb time management, judgment, decision-making and problem-solving skills • Thrives as both an independent contributor and as part of a collaborative team  • Expert high-impact communication and presentation skills • Organizational fit for the Axiom culture, that is, exhibits the core values of Irresistible, Fresh, Committed, & Thoughtful • Legally eligible to work in the country in which the position is located   Education   • Bachelor’s degree required    Axiom is an equal opportunity employer and committed to a diverse workforce.

We are currently looking for an experienced, dependable, and dedicated nurse to see patients in the Northern Neck area and be a part of our Virginia nursing team.  **Please understand that we are ONLY interested in nurses with home visiting experience so do NOT apply if you are not experienced in this specialty.**  We have partnered up with a nationally recognized senior health insurance company to provide care management services for their patients. The program provides one on one resource & care management assistance to seniors. We are looking for experienced registered nurses who have a strong background in geriatric nursing to do home visit assessments and phone follow up. This is a flexible, work-from-your-home position that requires driving to patients' homes in the Northern Neck area. You would set your own hours to coincide with your particular schedule. This position would be great for a retiring nurse or a nurse looking to downscale a hectic career. It is a wonderful job that provides part time hours to a stay at home mom or a nurse working on her bachelors or master’s degree. This is also an excellent job for a home health nurse or case manager to pick up extra income as a secondary job. It is MANDATORY that this person have some form of home health experience and it is strongly advised that they have case management experience as well because this position requires those skills/duties. It is imperative that we find a nurse who understands home visiting principles and the dynamic culture of the home visit nurse arena, because we will not provide that type of training. It is mandatory that this nurse has the proven ability to be self-directed, self-disciplined, and work effectively in an independent work environment such as Medicare skilled Home Health, public health, or Home Care Management, etc. There will be special training provided online regarding the senior insurance plan and their plans benefits. The ideal candidate will have a love for working with senior patients and have a special patience and a caring attitude with them. This is a truly enjoyable job where you can make a difference with senior adults who need some resources and encouragement with their health care compliance.   The main duties of the visits are service & resource coordination, very light teaching of meds & disease management, managing compliance with doctor visits & forging a strong relationship to gain their trust. Visits are typically 20 minutes, charting is done online and is very minimal (NO OASIS or any Medicare charting and no Medicare Regs to deal with!!) If you are a dependable, professional, responsible, compassionate & dedicated nurse, then we would love to talk to you to see if this would be the right fit for you as well as our company. An RN license without ANY disciplinary history on it with the state of Virginia is required as well as current CPR certification. In addition, you will have to satisfactorily pass a background check. The selected nurse will need to have a high speed Internet connection in their home with a scanner/printer as well as a working phone.It’s MANDATORY that the nurse be computer/Internet savvy! The nurse MUST have an XLNT working knowledge with computers, software, PDF files, emails and must be technologically minded and able to learn new software easily (please do not apply if you are overwhelmed by new software, the Internet, PDF files, or learning computer-related functions - this job is NOT for the computer-faint hearted). We will provide compensation in an hourly rate (we provide competitive wages for non-Medicare home visits in the Northern Neck area). We will also provide a communications reimbursement and a mileage reimbursement. This is a work-from-your-home position and the candidate MUST CURRENTLY live in the Northern Neck area because it is imperative to have quick, easy access to meeting with patients in their homes, on very rare occasions with shorter notice. ABSOLUTELY NO out-of-state candidates will be considered, so PLEASE do NOT apply. There is a lot of patient & family interaction, so because of this the candidate MUST have EXCELLENT ENGLISH speaking skills & a PROFICIENT command of the English language both orally and written. The patients & their families must be able to EASILY understand & comprehend your verbal patient teaching voice. Our senior health insurance partner as well as the patients & their families require that our employees have a strong & solid background as a nursing professional and be an upstanding, responsible individual, so please DO NOT respond if you have any of the following;  • A criminal record • Have been dismissed from a job/case for negative reasons • No reliable transportation • No car insurance • No valid driver's license • Have bad references or no references • Have any disciplinary action on your RN license with the State of Virginia • Have ever had a negative, corrupt, damaging, or flawed background check • Have poor documentation skills or poor ability to stay on track with charting • Poor or less than average English language speaking & written skills • Live outside of the Northern Neck Area. • Easily overwhelmed by learning new software or computer-related functions  If you have an impeccable work ethic and excellent work history with solid, positive references, and meet the above requirements, then please respond to this post with your name, resume, phone number, and the best time to reach you.  Compensation: $20 hourly rate base (up to $5/hr. pay increase at 90 days) + $40/month per patient on your caseload for communications reimbursement (average caseload 5-10 patients) (works out to approx. $45/hour) + mileage reimbursement
